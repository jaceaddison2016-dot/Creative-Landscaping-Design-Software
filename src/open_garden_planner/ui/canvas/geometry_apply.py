"""The canonical geometry-apply path for canvas items (US-D2.2 / D2.6).

Every rect-backed resize in this app funnels through
:func:`apply_rect_like_geometry` and the builders beside it. Before US-D2.2 each
caller — the three numeric-entry branches in ``properties_panel`` and the
drag-release handler on each item class — carried its own local ``apply_func``
closure for :class:`~open_garden_planner.core.commands.ResizeItemCommand`, and
the copies had **drifted**: the drag-release closures re-pin
``transformOriginPoint`` onto the new rect centre (the #218 fix), while the
properties-panel closures never did. A rotated circle resized from the panel
therefore jumped — measurably 73.2 cm for a 30 degree rotation and a 50 to
100 cm radius change — and at 0 degrees the drift is exactly zero, which is why
it survived so long. See ``docs/11-risks-and-technical-debt/`` section 11.4.

Adding the Agent API's ``resize_object`` (US-D2.2) would have made that another
copy, so the copies were collapsed instead. US-D2.6 extends the same rule to
vertex commands: interactive vertex commits and the Agent API's vertex escape
hatches share the builders in this module rather than each constructing a
private apply callback.

.. _canonical-callers:

Who shares this path — the authoritative list
---------------------------------------------
**This docstring is the single statement of it.** ADR-036, §8.19, §11.4,
FR-AGENT-15 and ``docs/roadmap.md`` all point here rather than paraphrasing,
because during review those five paraphrases drifted into three mutually
inconsistent answers — in a change whose entire thesis is that copies drift. If
you change this list, change it *here*; the enumerations that survive elsewhere
(§11.4's historical pre-extraction one in particular) are snapshots — where
they disagree with this list, this list wins.

:func:`apply_rect_like_geometry` is the ``apply_func`` for every rect-backed
resize:

* the three numeric-entry branches in ``ui/panels/properties_panel.py``;
* the drag-release handlers on ``CircleItem`` / ``RectangleItem`` /
  ``EllipseItem``;
* ``RectVertexEditMixin._on_corner_move_end`` — the corner-drag **undo**
  closure (the live drag in ``_move_corner_to`` applies geometry directly, but
  solves its position through the same :func:`anchored_position`);
* the EQUAL-constraint **rectangle** partner appliers
  (``core/tools/constraint_tool._apply_partner_extents``);
* the Agent API's ``resize_object``.

:func:`apply_rotation` has **exactly one** definition in the codebase, used by
every ``RotateItemCommand`` call site, for every item type. Drift-guarded.

The vertex builders — :func:`build_move_vertex_command`,
:func:`build_add_vertex_command`, and :func:`build_delete_vertex_command` —
are the one construction path for `MoveVertexCommand`, `AddVertexCommand`, and
`DeleteVertexCommand`. Their callers are the interactive vertex commit methods
on ``VertexEditMixin`` / ``PolylineVertexEditMixin`` and the Agent API's
``set_vertex`` / ``add_vertex`` / ``delete_vertex`` tools. The item-local
``_move_vertex_to`` / ``_insert_vertex`` / ``_remove_vertex`` methods remain the
one low-level mutation implementation for polygon and polyline vertices.

Two deliberate exceptions, both verified rather than assumed:

* **``PolygonItem``'s resize** keeps its own closure — its geometry dict is a
  *vertex list*, a different geometry model rather than a copy of this one.
  Vertex geometry belongs to the vertex tools.
* **``constraint_tool.circle_apply``** keeps its own — it rebuilds the rect
  around the *same local centre*, so ``_center``, ``rect().center()`` and
  ``transformOriginPoint`` stay coincident and it is already rotation-correct.
  Measured across rotations, not argued.

An extraction that claims "every caller" is worse than one that names its
exceptions, because the next reader stops looking (§11.4).

Qt-touching and **main-thread only** — the Agent API reaches it through
``MainThreadBridge``, never from the server thread.

Geometry dicts
--------------
One shape, used by every caller and stored in the undo stack::

    {"rect_x", "rect_y", "width", "height", "pos_x", "pos_y"}

plus, for :class:`~open_garden_planner.ui.canvas.items.CircleItem` only, the
bookkeeping the class keeps alongside its rect::

    {"center_x", "center_y", "radius"}

The dict is a *complete* description of the item's geometry, because
``ResizeItemCommand`` replays it in both directions: ``execute`` applies the
new dict and ``undo`` applies the old one through the same function.

Anchor policy
-------------
Two policies, both expressed through the same builder:

* **centre-preserving** (``keep_center=True``) — the object's scene centre is
  invariant. This is what the Agent API uses for every type, because
  ``create_object`` and every read tool speak in centres, so it is the only
  rule an agent can reason about without knowing an item's internal anchor.
  It is also what the panel already does for circles.
* **anchor-preserving** (``keep_center=False``) — the local rect origin is
  left alone, so the item grows right/down in item coordinates; ``pos`` is
  untouched at rotation 0 and recomputed under rotation so the scene top-left
  stays pinned (``anchored_position``, not a no-op). This is the panel's
  long-standing behaviour for rectangles and ellipses and is preserved
  exactly.

Both go through :func:`~open_garden_planner.ui.canvas.items.resize_handle.anchored_position`,
the single solved form of Qt's rotation transform, so neither policy can drift
from the other under rotation.
