"""The one apply path for per-object stacking-order changes (issue #338).

Every surface that performs "Bring to Front / Bring Forward / Send Backward
/ Send to Back" — the Edit menu, each item's context menu, the Properties
panel's Arrange buttons, and the Agent API's ``arrange_object`` tool — funnels
through :func:`build_arrange_command`. Before this module existed each of
those surfaces would have needed its own copy of "group the selection by
layer, ask ``core.stacking.arrange`` what changed, build the command" — and
copies drift (see ``ui/canvas/geometry_apply.py`` for the shape of that
lesson on the resize/rotate side). There is exactly one seam here; if you
find yourself reaching for a second one, use this one instead.

:func:`build_arrange_command` is Qt-aware (it reads live ``QGraphicsItem``
state — layer membership, scene bounding rects, the scene's derived stacking
order) but pushes all the actual reordering logic down into the Qt-free
:mod:`open_garden_planner.core.stacking` module, so the algorithm itself
stays unit-testable without ``qtbot``.

    """Build the undoable command for arranging *items* within their layer(s).

    Journal pins and items without a resolvable layer are dropped first (they
    never take part in stacking). The remaining items are grouped by layer;
    each layer's current stacking order is fetched from the scene
    (:meth:`CanvasScene._stack_entries`, the ONE place that builds
    ``StackEntry`` objects from live items) and handed to
    :func:`core.stacking.arrange`, which decides what changes for that layer
    alone. A selection spanning several layers therefore still becomes one
    undo step — each layer's block is arranged within its own layer only.

    Args:
        scene: The canvas scene.
        items: Candidate items (typically the current selection).
        mode: Which of the four arrange gestures to perform.

    Returns:
        ``(command, ArrangeOutcome.CHANGED)`` when at least one layer's order
        actually changed — the caller still needs to
        ``command_manager.execute(command)``. Otherwise ``(None, outcome)``,
        where *outcome* is ``NOTHING_SELECTED`` when no eligible item remains
        after filtering, or the first affected layer's non-CHANGED outcome
        (already at front/back, or no overlapping object to step past).
