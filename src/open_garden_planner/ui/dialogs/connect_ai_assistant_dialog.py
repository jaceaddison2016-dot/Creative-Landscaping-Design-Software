"""Connect-your-AI-assistant dialog (US-D1.6, generalized by issue #366).

Thin Qt shell over ``services/ai_client_onboarding.py``. Every client row is
built from the service's ``TARGETS`` registry, so a new client appears here
with no change to this file — the dialog knows nothing about any specific
vendor.

Three things this dialog owns (the service owns the mechanics):

* **The read-only URL is the default hand-out.** The connect URL can carry the
  Agent API's D2 write token, and pasting that into an assistant chat publishes
  the credential to whatever stores the transcript. So "Copy read-only URL" is
  the primary button, and the write URL sits behind a separate, explicitly
  worded action that says the token is in it.
* **A generic fallback that is always present**, even when nothing is
  detected, so a client OGP has never heard of is still one paste away.
* **Honest per-client state** — detected / registered / stale — instead of a
  button that silently re-registers nothing.

All prose here is UI copy and goes through ``self.tr()``; the URL, server
name, and snippet payloads are agent data and are never translated (mirrors
ADR-033's "MCP tool/resource descriptions are English" precedent — the same
reason client ``display_name``s stay English).

Client rows sit inside a ``QScrollArea`` so revealing a manual snippet scrolls
it into view instead of pushing the Close button off a fixed-size dialog
(issue #253) — and now also so the larger registry still fits.
