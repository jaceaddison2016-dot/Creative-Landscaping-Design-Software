"""Shared helpers for the plant database panel and search dialog.

Two responsibilities:

  * Assigning a database species to an existing plant item, used by both the
    plant database panel (Load Custom / Create Custom) and the Plants-menu
    species search so that every "assign species to an existing plant" path
    behaves identically (issue #213): writes ``metadata['plant_species']``;
    resizes the drawn footprint so its diameter equals the species'
    ``max_spread_cm`` (the visible change the issue requires) — silently,
    unless a manual ``spacing_radius_cm`` override conflicts, in which case
    the user is prompted to apply the database values or keep their custom
    ones; records a single undoable step (``ApplySpeciesCommand``).
  * ``plant_source_label()``, a translated human-readable label for where a
    plant record's data came from — shared by the search dialog's results
    list and the panel's "Data Source" tooltip (issue #297) so the two
    can't independently drift out of translation sync.
