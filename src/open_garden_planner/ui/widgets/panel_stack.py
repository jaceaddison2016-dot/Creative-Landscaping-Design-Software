"""Sidebar panel stack: hover-peek, click-to-toggle, fill-the-surplus accordion.

``SidebarController`` owns the sidebar layout and a per-panel state machine
(:class:`PanelState`). All panels live — in a fixed canonical order that never
changes — in a single ``QVBoxLayout`` inside a ``QScrollArea``: a panel is never
reparented, so opening/closing one cannot reorder the list. An open panel floors
at its content height and carries a content-weighted layout stretch factor, so it
absorbs the surplus sidebar space (one open panel fills the sidebar; several share
the surplus weighted by content size); the sidebar scrolls when their combined
content overflows. See ADR-030 / arc42 §8.17.
