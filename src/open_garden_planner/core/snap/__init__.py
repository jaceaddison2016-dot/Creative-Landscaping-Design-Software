"""Unified snap engine.

A small abstraction over the existing :mod:`measure_snapper` and
:mod:`snapping` modules.  Providers expose snap candidates and the
``SnapRegistry`` orchestrates which providers are active.  This package
adds two new snap modes (midpoint, intersection) on top of the legacy
anchor and bounding-box logic.
