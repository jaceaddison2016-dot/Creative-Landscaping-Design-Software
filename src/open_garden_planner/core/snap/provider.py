"""Snap provider abstraction.

A ``SnapProvider`` enumerates ``SnapCandidate`` points around a query
position.  The ``PointSnapper`` runs every enabled provider and picks
the closest candidate within the configured threshold.

Each provider owns one snap *mode* (endpoint, center, midpoint,
intersection, etc.).  Modes can be enabled/disabled individually by the
user via the View menu.
