"""Effective object height resolution for the Phase 14 sun/shade features
(US-E2, #257).

One source of truth for "how tall is this object above ground?" — consumed
by the 2D shadow overlay (US-E3), the hours-of-sun heatmap (US-E4) and the
3D extrusion (US-E6). Deliberately Qt-free (pattern: ``core/plant_sizing``,
``core/container_model``): it takes the object type and the item's
``metadata`` dict, never a QGraphicsItem, so it is unit-testable headless.

Height precedence (ADR-037):

1. ``metadata["object_height_cm"]`` — an explicit, user-set height.
2. Containers — ``container_height_cm`` (the soil *fill* height from
   ``core/container_model``). NOTE: the two keys are deliberately distinct
   and never aliased: a tall pot on legs can have ``object_height_cm`` 90
   with a fill height of 30; the fill height keeps driving soil volume.
3. Plants — in order:
   a. with a species, a planting date AND a measured current height, and
      when ``at_date`` is given — the DATE-PROJECTED height from
      ``core/growth_model`` (current → species max over years-to-maturity);
   b. else the measured ``current_height_cm`` (``plant_instance``) if set —
      the owner-chosen "current height anchors it" rule, so the field the
      user types drives the shadow directly. Applies even with NO species
      attached (an unknown/custom name is a supported state). NOTE this
      rule is metadata-driven, not type-driven: any object carrying a
      ``plant_instance`` height gets it. Only plant items are given that
      metadata today, so the distinction is currently inert;
   c. else, with a species, its mature ``max_height_cm`` (the established
      linkage, cf. ``plant_sizing.sizing_for_item``).
4. A per-object-type default (``DEFAULT_HEIGHTS_CM`` below).
5. ``None`` — the object has no meaningful height and casts no shadow.

``object_height_cm`` is ADDITIVE item metadata: it round-trips through the
``.ogp`` serializer wholesale and old app versions ignore it (graceful
degrade) — NO FILE_VERSION bump (precedent: the ``container_*`` keys).

To stay Qt-free this module never imports ``core.object_types`` (which
pulls in Qt for its translated labels); object types are matched by
their enum ``name``. ``tests/unit/test_object_height.py`` pins the name
sets against the real enum so a rename cannot silently break the mapping.
