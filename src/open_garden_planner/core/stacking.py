"""Per-object stacking order within a layer (issue #338).

Pure, Qt-free core logic for "Bring to Front / Bring Forward / Send Backward
/ Send to Back". Operates on a single layer's bottom-to-top list of
:class:`StackEntry` (never on ``QGraphicsItem`` directly) so it can be
unit-tested without ``qtbot`` or any Qt runtime.

Concepts
--------
- A **rank** (``stack_order`` on the Qt side) is a sparse integer sort key;
  this module never invents ranks, it only reorders a list.
- A **block** is the set of selected items plus the children (in the same
  layer) of any selected plant-parent — bed + its plants move together.
- **Normalization** enforces the derive-only clamp: a child (plant → bed,
  ROOF_RIDGE → owner polygon) always renders immediately above its parent,
  regardless of where the raw arrange step would otherwise have put it. This
  is why "Send to Back" on a lone plant stops just above its bed instead of
  actually reaching the bottom of the layer.

See ``docs/09-architecture-decisions/`` ADR-043 and
``docs/08-crosscutting-concepts/`` section 8.25 for the full design.
