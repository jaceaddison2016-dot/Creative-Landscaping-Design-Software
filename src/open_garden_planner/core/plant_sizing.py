"""Single source of truth for plant sizing precedence.

A plant's size is governed by three independent quantities that used to have
their precedence re-encoded in three places (``garden_item`` resolver,
``circle_item`` paint/boundingRect ring gate, and the species-assignment
helper). This module collapses that into one documented value object so the
rules live in exactly one file (issue #218).

The three quantities:

* **footprint** — the drawn circle radius (``CircleItem._radius``).
* **spacing override** — a user-set planting distance (``spacing_radius_cm``),
  or ``None`` for "use the database".
* **max_spread_cm** — the database value from ``metadata["plant_species"]``.

Precedence (unchanged behaviour, see ``PlantSizing.effective_spacing_radius_cm``):
the manual override wins; otherwise the database ``max_spread_cm / 2``; otherwise
there is no spacing data. The spacing ring is drawn only when the effective
spacing radius exceeds the drawn footprint (a ring that would sit inside the
footprint conveys nothing — the footprint already shows that size).

This module is intentionally Qt-free so the precedence can be unit-tested in
isolation.

US-E8 note — a fourth size input this module deliberately does NOT own: the
plant's measured ``plant_instance["current_spread_cm"]``, read by
``core/growth_model`` and the shadow/3D canopy. It does **not** affect the
spacing ring or the spacing-overlap diagnostic, which stay on the MATURE
``max_spread_cm`` — spacing is a planning-for-maturity rule, so shrinking it
to a sapling's current canopy would let the user plant too densely.

Update (issue #299): the drawn circle's own SVG icon is no longer part of
this module's "stays mature" guarantee either — ``CircleItem`` renders it at
the growth-model size when available (``_visual_plant_diameter_cm``), while
``rect()``/``radius`` (what THIS module reads) stay exactly as documented
above. One plant can therefore legitimately show FOUR different sizes at
once: the drawn circle's *geometry* (selection/snapping/spacing, still owned
by this module), a mature spacing ring (also this module), a
growth-sized icon (owned by ``CircleItem``, cosmetic only — never read by
anything in this module), and a growth-sized shadow canopy (owned by
``core/growth_model`` + the sun/shade views). The four are independent by
design; this module's job is only ever the first two.
