# Texture Provenance (US-E9 #264 → Package 3b #309, ADR-042 / FR-30)

Every texture in this folder MUST have an entry here before it merges
(`ogp-external-positioning`: assets without provenance don't ship). Since
Package 3b (2026-08-18) the entry is the same for all 24 files, because they
all come out of one generator:

- **Generator**: `scripts/generate_asset_forge_textures.py` — procedural,
  in-repo, **numpy float64 painter on a torus** (analytic anti-aliased
  coverage, radial rim → crown shading, concentric occlusion halos, periodic
  lattice/fBm noise, torus Voronoi, in-repo wrap-aware Gaussian blur); Pillow
  is used only to encode/decode PNG. **No external model, service, photo or
  third-party asset was used for any texture.**
- **Seed**: one deterministic string per texture, `ogp-<name>-lush`
  (`seed_for()`), fed to `random.Random` — stream-stable across CPython
  versions and platforms.
- **Date**: 2026-08-18 (all 24 regenerated in the "Lush" language — final
  regeneration after two senior-review rounds: pixel-centre sampling for
  windows, analytic fields, noise and Voronoi; roof overhang RNG replay; the
  US-E9 pilots decking/corten of 2026-07-20 and the #281 hedge of
  2026-07-27 were re-rendered through the same painter — their pixels
  changed, their look and seeds were kept).
- **Reproduction**: run the script; `--check` regenerates in memory and
  compares the DECODED PIXELS of every committed PNG (pinned by
  `tests/unit/test_texture_forge_conformance.py`). Pixels — not file bytes —
  are the contract: PNG is lossless, but the deflate stream depends on the
  zlib build Pillow bundles, so a Windows wheel and a Linux CI wheel may
  encode identical pixels to different bytes. Regeneration rewrites a file
  only when its pixels change (no cross-platform git noise).
- **License basis**: original work generated in-repo; distributed under the
  project license (GPL-3.0-or-later).
- **Tileability**: seamless BY CONSTRUCTION (every primitive is painted with
  torus-wrapped window indices; noise fields are periodic; structured
  layouts divide the tile exactly, so a joint either straddles the wrap
  symmetrically or lies clear of it — never near it asymmetrically);
  mechanically verified by `scripts/check_texture_tileability.py`
  (seam-vs-98th-percentile metric, threshold 1.6 unchanged since #264),
  pinned for ALL 24 files by `tests/unit/test_texture_tileability.py`
  (parametrized over every file — the #264 grandfather list was emptied and
  deleted) and on the real canvas brush (both axes) by
  `tests/integration/test_texture_forge_rendering.py`.
- **Style**: the "Lush" texture contract — `ogp-asset-forge` skill §1 and
  docs §8.24. Owner sign-off: contact sheets (legacy · new · 2×2 tiled ·
  tinted with the real default fill colour) sent 2026-08-18; final sign-off is
  the Package-3b manual test of the draft PR.

## History

- **2026-03**: 22 legacy textures painted with `QPainter` by
  `scripts/generate_textures.py` (Phase 1 asset pipeline; grandfathered
  without per-file provenance). Removed in #309.
- **2026-07-20 (US-E9, #264)**: `decking.png` / `corten.png` pilots from the
  first Pillow forge (fixed seed 42, `ImageFilter.GaussianBlur` — reproducible
  per Pillow version only); tileability gate + this file introduced;
  `flagstone.png` / `glass.png` recorded as seamed regeneration candidates.
- **2026-07-27 (#281 / PR #282)**: `hedge.png` regenerated in the Lush leaf
  language (seed `ogp-hedge-lush`).
- **2026-08-18 (#309, Package 3b)**: all 24 textures regenerated by the
  numpy torus painter; Pillow blur removed; pixel-exact `--check`; seam list
  emptied; legacy Qt generator deleted.
