# Plant sprites — style contract (binding)

All SVGs in `species/` (108) and `categories/` (15) are **generated** by
`scripts/generate_plant_sprites.py`. **Do not hand-edit** — edit the recipe
table in the script and regenerate; `--check` (and the unit gate
`tests/unit/test_plant_sprite_conformance.py`) fails on any drift.

## The "Lush Sprite" style (user-approved 2026-07-26, issue #281)

1. **Top-down view, radial shading only.** Light comes from straight above:
   dark rim → light crown. Never bake a directional light — the canvas
   applies a stable random rotation per plant (`core/plant_renderer.py`),
   and radial shading stays correct under any rotation.
2. **Individual leaves in shingled rings.** Each leaf: dark occlusion copy
   underneath (the depth effect), body with a linear gradient from warm
   light tip to cool dark base, optional gloss inset + midrib.
3. **Signature features on top**: glossy fruit (radial gradient + occlusion
   ring + white specular), chunky bloom clusters/puffs, pods, umbels, and
   for root vegetables the bulb "shoulder" visible at the center.
4. **Recognizability beats botany** at plan scale: every species keeps one
   signature cue (fruit color, bloom shape, rib color, bulb, silhouette).
5. **QtSvg subset only** (QSvgRenderer ≈ SVG 1.2 Tiny): linear/radial
   gradients, opacity, transforms, stroke-linecap. **No** filters, masks,
   clipPath, CSS classes, `<text>`, `<image>`, external refs.
6. **Geometry**: viewBox `0 0 100 100`, content inside radius ≈46 around
   (50, 50). Exception: `categories/hedge_section.svg` keeps its legacy
   rectangular viewBox `10 25 80 50`.
7. **Deterministic**: every sprite is seeded by its name — regeneration
   reproduces identical bytes.
8. **Visual weight (gated)**: ink coverage at 64 px (alpha > 10, 2-px
   sampling, ground shadow included) stays within **[0.30, 0.75]** per
   species and **[0.30, 0.95]** per category (`hedge_section` is a
   deliberately solid tile), species max/min spread ≤ **2.0×** (tighter than
   the band ratio, so the spread rule binds on its own), and every sprite
   keeps ≥ 0.32 coverage at 16 px (growth-model size). Shipped set
   measures 0.383–0.634 (spread 1.66×). Enforced by
   `tests/integration/test_plant_sprite_rendering.py`.
   Ball-shaped canopies/mounds additionally follow the **dome rule**: leaf
   size shrinks and density grows toward the rim (foreshortened sphere seen
   from above); flat growth forms (rosettes, tufts, narrow-leaf cushions)
   are exempt from the foreshortening. Independent of archetype, small
   leaves (< 12 units long) render with smooth occlusion and no veins — a
   byte-budget simplification, visually identical at canvas scale.
9. **Palette lives in the generator**: colors come exclusively from the
   `PALETTES`/`FRUITS`/`FLOWERS` anchor tables and per-recipe feature colors,
   derived via `mix()`/`lighten()` — never from hand-edited SVG. Enforcement
   is transitive: byte-determinism pins every color to the tables, and the
   conformance gate rejects malformed color values and non-allowlisted
   elements/attributes.

## Changing or adding a sprite

1. Edit `SPECIES` / `CATEGORIES` in `scripts/generate_plant_sprites.py`
   (archetype + palette + feature recipe; new species also need a
   `_SPECIES_FILES` alias in `core/plant_renderer.py`).
2. `venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/generate_plant_sprites.py`
3. Visually review with the app's real engine (see the `ogp-asset-forge`
   skill, "SVG sprite forge": render grids offscreen, view, iterate — never
   judge by XML or a browser).
4. `pytest tests/unit/test_plant_sprite_conformance.py tests/integration/test_plant_sprite_rendering.py`
5. Owner sign-off on a contact sheet for style changes (style is sovereign).
