       (the crops planted concurrently elsewhere in the plan) is excluded,
       reusing the companion service rather than a second relationship lookup.
    3. **Window fit** — ranked by whether ``days_to_maturity`` fits the gap. An

       fit: an unfalsifiable "fits" is the same fabrication class as a

            read from a field, because there is no such field — deriving it a
            second way is how per-species state desyncs.
        gap_start: ISO start of the gap.
        gap_end: ISO end of the gap.
        avoid_families: Families to avoid from the cross-year cooldown.
