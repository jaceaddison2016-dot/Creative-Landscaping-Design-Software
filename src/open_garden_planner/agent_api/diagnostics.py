"""Pure (Qt-free) mapping from harvested warning flags to Agent API diagnostics.

``get_diagnostics`` reports the plan's **already-computed** warnings — the same
state the canvas paints as badges — rather than recomputing anything. The Qt
main thread harvests each garden item's current flags into plain dicts (see
``ProjectManager.diagnostics_snapshot``); this module turns those records into
:class:`~open_garden_planner.agent_api.schema.Diagnostic` entries. No PyQt6, no
mcp — unit-testable without a GUI.

One record may yield several diagnostics (a plant can be both crowded and next to
an antagonist). Positive indicators are intentionally NOT reported: spacing
``"ideal"`` and rotation ``"good"`` are good-state markers, not warnings.
