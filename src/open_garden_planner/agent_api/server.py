"""Embedded MCP server for the Agent API (US-D1.1–D1.6, US-D2.0–D2.6).

Runs an MCP streamable-HTTP server inside the running GUI on a background daemon
thread, bound to loopback only. Structural, spatial, diagnostics, and vision
(render) query tools are read-only. US-D1.4 adds four file-producing tools
(``save_plan``/``export_pdf``/``export_dxf``/``export_csv``) that write a file
to disk via the same services the GUI's File > Export/Save menu already calls
— they don't need the token auth D2's scene-mutating write tools use
(ADR-033): ``save_plan`` persists exactly what's already on screen (the same
effect as Ctrl+S), and the export tools produce a new deliverable file without
touching the live plan. The D2 write surface and its global ``undo``/``redo``
providers reuse the same ``MainThreadBridge`` boundary (via the injected
``AgentProviders`` callables) for every scene edit. US-D1.5 adds 5 read-only
resources (``garden://plan``,
``garden://plan/raw``, ``garden://canvas.png``, ``garden://diagnostics``,
``garden://species``) and 2 read-analysis prompts (``audit-plan``,
``describe-garden``) — see the resource/prompt registrations at the bottom of
``build_server()`` below.

``FastMCP``/``uvicorn`` are imported lazily inside functions so importing the
``agent_api`` package costs nothing until the server is actually started (see
``agent_api/__init__.py``'s own lazy ``__getattr__`` gate, which is what keeps
importing *this* module itself deferred). ``Image`` is imported eagerly at
module level: with ``from __future__ import annotations`` in effect, every
``@mcp.tool()`` registration calls ``inspect.signature(func, eval_str=True)``
inside the SDK's ``func_metadata`` (this runs unconditionally, regardless of
``structured_output``) to resolve each stringified annotation via the
*function's own* ``__globals__`` — not the enclosing ``build_server()``
call's locals — so a tool parameter/return type must be a real module-level
name, not merely imported inside ``build_server()`` (empirically confirmed:
the latter raises ``NameError`` at server-build time). Both names live under
the same ``mcp.server.fastmcp`` package, so this costs nothing extra beyond
what ``FastMCP`` already pays the moment the server actually starts.

**Resources are simpler than tools** (verified by reading ``mcp`` 1.28.1's
``fastmcp/server.py``/``fastmcp/resources/types.py``/``lowlevel/server.py``
source directly, US-D1.5): ``@mcp.resource(uri)`` only calls plain
``inspect.signature(fn)`` (no ``eval_str``) to detect URI/function params, and
every resource here is zero-argument, so the tool-only ``NameError`` gotcha
above does not apply. ``FunctionResource.read()`` returns ``bytes`` as-is,
``str`` as-is, and anything else (a pydantic model, a plain ``dict``/``list``)
via ``pydantic_core.to_json(..., fallback=str)`` — no manual
``json.dumps``/``model_dump_json()`` needed for ``garden://plan``/``garden://
plan/raw``/``garden://diagnostics``/``garden://species``. The lowlevel
``read_resource`` handler then pattern-matches the result: ``bytes`` ->
``BlobResourceContents`` (base64-encoded, using the resource's declared
``mime_type``), ``str`` -> ``TextResourceContents``. So ``garden://
canvas.png`` just returns raw PNG ``bytes`` with ``mime_type="image/png"`` on
the decorator — **no** ``Image``/``structured_output=False`` workaround (that
was specifically a tool-dispatch quirk, D1.3). ``@mcp.prompt()`` is equally
direct: a plain ``str`` return is wrapped as
``[UserMessage(TextContent(text=result))]`` automatically.

# therefore gate PER TOOL, not with a blanket middleware over the whole server.
#
# ``_bearer_token_middleware`` (applied to the ASGI app in ``_start_locked``)
# reads the token off every HTTP request (from the ``Authorization: Bearer``
# header or a ``?token=`` URL query param) and stashes it in this ContextVar.
# Each write tool's ``async``
# handler then calls ``_require_write_auth`` — which runs in the SAME request
# task as the middleware, so it sees that request's token — BEFORE any thread
# offload. Verified end-to-end against mcp 1.28.1 with ``stateless_http=True``.

# JSON-serializable sentinel preserves omission while allowing the create

    Pure ASGI (no Starlette ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``) so it adds no per-request
    task hop and can't interfere with the streamable-HTTP body streaming. Only
    HTTP scopes carry a token; anything else passes straight through.

    A client may present the token two ways, checked in this order:

    1. ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` header — the conventional route.
    2. A ``?token=<token>`` URL query parameter — the fallback, because some
       MCP clients (notably Claude Code on streamable-HTTP, anthropics/
       claude-code#50464 / #28293) store a configured header but omit it on
       tool-call POSTs, while the configured URL (query string included) is
       always transmitted since it's the request target. Delivering the secret
       in the URL preserves the same threat model (a caller without the token
       still can't write) without depending on header transmission.

    The **URL query token wins** when both are present: it is the reliable
    primary channel (some clients drop configured headers on tool calls), so a
    stale legacy ``Authorization`` header left in a config can't shadow a fresh
    URL token. Validation (constant-time compare, ASCII guard) happens later in
    ``_require_write_auth``.

    A query token is **stripped from ``scope["query_string"]`` immediately**
    (whether or not a header is also present) so no downstream ASGI handler or
    access log can observe the secret (defense-in-depth; the MCP app routes on
    the path, not the query, so nothing after us needs the ``token`` param).

          overlaps it and there is normally no concurrent neighbour to exclude.
          The antagonism filter only bites when a slot from OUTSIDE this plan
          overlaps the window; when none does it excludes nothing, and the
          absence of a rejection is not evidence that a candidate is

        Defaults to today +/- 30 days. Pass `today` to make the answer
        reproducible: the same inputs always return the same tasks, and an
        omitted `today` means the real current date.

        The default mirrors the GUI's actionable reminders. An explicit date
        window generates the complete schedule for its calendar years before
        filtering, including past/future tasks with null urgency. Propagation
        uses the GUI's calculator, seed-packet data and stored overrides.

        Each task carries the generator's own fields PLUS two the engine does not
        store: `urgency`, computed at render time from the dates and the
        reference date ('today', 'overdue', 'this_week', 'upcoming', or null when
        not actionable), and `status`, read from the same store the Tasks tab
        uses ('open', 'done', 'snoozed', 'dismissed' or 'archived').

        TWO KINDS OF FIELD, and the difference matters:

        * `task_id`, `task_type` and `source` are stable English machine keys and
          part of this API's contract. Branch on these.
        * `title` and `notes` are DISPLAY STRINGS in the user's current UI
          language, because the generators build them through Qt's translation
          layer. They are NOT part of the English contract. Never parse them,
          and never match on them — under a German UI they are German.

        `coverage` says what the answer is built on:

        * 'full' - the plan has a location, so frost dates exist and the
          calendar and propagation tasks were generated.
        * 'no_frost_dates' - the plan has NO geo-location, so there are no
          frost dates and NO calendar or propagation tasks exist. Every other
          task kind (manual, succession, soil, frost) is still returned. This is
          NOT 'there is nothing to do' — the engine could not compute the
          planting calendar. Say so rather than reporting an empty week.

        Generated tasks cannot be edited or deleted: they are derived state
        rebuilt on every call. Use add_manual_task for new work, and tell the
        user to dismiss or complete a task in the Tasks tab — a status change is
        not an undoable agent write, so it is deliberately not exposed here.

        A task is counted in EVERY month its window touches, so a three-week
        task spanning a month boundary appears in both. `total` therefore counts
        task-months, not distinct tasks.

        Generates the COMPLETE requested calendar year rather than only today's
        actionable reminders. A cross-year window is clipped to this year;
        urgency still uses `today`, not an invented date in the requested year.

        `actionable` counts the tasks whose urgency is not null — the ones worth
        reading. A task with no urgency is not urgent and is not in that count,
        but it is still in `total` and in `by_urgency` under 'none'.

        `coverage` carries the same meaning as in `get_tasks`: 'no_frost_dates'

        be generated. It never means the year is empty.

        Answers the question `get_diagnostics` cannot: it tells you a plant
        disagrees with its soil, and this tells you the actual pH and NPK, how
        healthy each is, and when the soil was last tested.

        `record_source` says WHICH record answered, and you must relay it:

        * 'bed' - the bed's own most recent test.
        * 'global' - the PLAN-WIDE default's most recent test, because this bed
          has none of its own. These readings are a plan-wide assumption, not a
          measurement of this bed.
        * 'none' - neither exists; `coverage` is 'no_soil_test'.

        `coverage: 'no_soil_test'` means UNTESTED, never 'the soil is fine'. There
        is no such thing as a passing grade for a missing test.

        `beds` holds one result for the requested bed. Omit `bed_id` to get
        every soil-capable bed in the plan, sorted by UUID. Each result carries
        its own `record_source` and `coverage`; no beds means an empty list.

        `levels` is keyed by the stable nutrient key 'n', 'p', 'k', 'ca', 'mg',
        's'. Each carries the recorded kit level and its derived `health_level`
        ('unknown', 'good', 'fair', 'poor'). A null level means not tested, and
        its health_level is 'unknown' for N/P/K — a gap in the data, not a poor
        reading. Ca/Mg/S carry null health_level because the engine defines no
        rating for those secondaries, even when a kit level was recorded.

        `overall_health_level` is the WORST non-unknown level across pH and the
        N/P/K, and 'unknown' only when all four inputs are unknown. It does not
        rate Ca/Mg/S.

        `is_test_overdue` is the app's own seasonal staleness check. When it is
        true, say the reading is old rather than recommending against it.

        construction — if they ever disagree, that is a bug worth reporting.

        `reason_codes` are stable English machine keys, and they are what you

        them — the numbers in them are formatted for a human.

        Note the asymmetry the codes make explicit: a pH mismatch is reported for
        ANY plant whose range the soil falls outside, whereas a nutrient
        mismatch needs BOTH a heavy feeder AND a low reading. A plant absent from
        this list is not necessarily happy — it may simply not have declared a
        requirement that the soil breaks.

        `beds` groups results by bed UUID. Each result has its own `coverage`,

        neither the bed nor the plan has a record: UNTESTED, not 'no disagreements'.

            the read tools report, so to move an object south you pass a NEGATIVE
            dy.

            Moving a bed/container/trellis carries its contained plants along.
            Moving a plant re-evaluates its bed membership afterward — crossing

            it becomes two only when reparenting happens (see the result's
            children_moved/bed_membership_changed/new_parent_bed_id).

            The move is CLAMPED to the canvas: an offset that would push the
            object (or a plant it carries) fully off-plan is trimmed so the
            object stays at the canvas edge instead. An object that is ALREADY

            moves: call get_geometry on the blocking object to inspect the
            constraint, then remove/edit it in the app. Journal pins also remain
