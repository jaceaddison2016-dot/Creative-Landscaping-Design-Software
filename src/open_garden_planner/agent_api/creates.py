"""Qt-free validation + ``.ogp``-dict building for ``create_object`` (US-D2.1/D2.5).

Kept import-light like :mod:`~open_garden_planner.agent_api.mapping`: no PyQt6.
The object-type name sets are inlined rather than importing
``core.object_types`` (which pulls in ``QColor`` and the rest of Qt);
``tests/unit/test_agent_api_creates.py`` guards every set against drift from the
real ``ObjectType`` definitions — including the US-D2.5 whole-roster guard:
creatable ∪ excluded must equal every ``ObjectType`` member, so a NEW enum
member fails the tests until someone decides whether an agent may create it.

The dict this module builds is handed straight to
``ProjectManager._deserialize_item_core`` — the same factory the ``.ogp`` file
loader uses. That is deliberate: an agent-created object is then constructed by
exactly the code path a loaded one is, so there is no second item-construction
path to drift (see the "two divergent item serializers" weak point in
``ogp-architecture-contract`` §4).

Coordinates follow the rest of the Agent API: ``x``/``y`` are the object's
**centre** in scene cm, CAD Y-up (a larger y is further north). Rectangles are
serialised top-left-anchored, so the centre is converted to the stored anchor
here — ``anchor = centre - extent / 2`` holds in either y-direction reading, so
this conversion is frame-agnostic and cannot introduce a Y-flip bug. Polygons
and polylines take their vertices as ``points`` in the SAME Y-up scene frame —
no conversion at all (the loader's polygon/polyline branches store scene
coordinates directly), which is what makes the #267-style Y-flip impossible
here and numerically pinnable in the tests.

#
# 1. Canvas-relative, applied to every type: an object may be at most this
#    multiple of the plan's larger dimension. Generous enough for a bed that

#    that a 100x unit slip is refused with an error naming the real plan size.
_MAX_EXTENT_CANVAS_MULTIPLE = 2.0

#    `plant_renderer.render_plant_pixmap`, which does `size = max(int(diameter), 4)`
#    and allocates a `size x size` ARGB QImage -- in scene CM, not device pixels.
#    That is quadratic and runs on the Qt main thread: measured on a dev machine,
#    diameter 8000 cm costs ~0.26 GB / 0.5 s, 24000 cm costs ~2.3 GB / 3.0 s, and
#    a large enough value fails allocation and yields a NULL (not None) QPixmap
#    that the paint path forwards to drawPixmap unchecked. 5000 cm (a 50 m

        height: Height in cm — same rule as ``width``.
        radius: Radius in cm — for circle-based types. Optional for plants

            other circle type, which has no meaningful default size.
        points: Vertex list ``[[x, y], ...]`` in scene cm (Y-up) — required for
            polyline types; for polygon types either this OR the centre +
            width/height convenience, never both.
        text: Callout text — required for GENERIC_CALLOUT, refused elsewhere.
        box_dx: Callout text-box offset from the arrow tip, X (default 80 cm).

        box_dy: Callout text-box offset from the arrow tip, Y (default -60 cm).
