"""Qt-free validation for the Agent API's edit tools (US-D2.2/D2.3/D2.6).

The counterpart to :mod:`~open_garden_planner.agent_api.creates`: that module
validates and builds a *new* object, this one validates a change to an object
that already exists — ``resize_object`` / ``rotate_object`` (US-D2.2),
``set_species`` / ``set_parent_bed`` (US-D2.3), and the D2.6 scene-point and
vertex-index validation used by the low-level geometry escape hatches.

Kept import-light on the same terms as ``creates``: no PyQt6, so the object-type
name sets are inlined rather than importing ``core.object_types`` (which pulls
in ``QColor`` and the rest of Qt). ``tests/unit/test_agent_api_edits.py`` guards
the inlined plant-parent set against drift from the real ``ObjectType``
definitions — the inlining is only safe because that guard exists. Vertex minima
are not inlined: the item's own protocol supplies them.

Shape validation deliberately lives *outside* this module. Whether an object can
be resized at all is a question about the Qt item backing it (rect-backed vs
vertex-backed), not about its type name, so it is answered by
``ui.canvas.geometry_apply.is_resizable_rect_like`` on the main thread; this
module validates the *numbers* and the *relationships*.
