"""JavaScript-API view capture support for the satellite import (#346, #347).

For projects affected by Google's EEA restrictions the Static Maps API
rejects ``satellite``/``hybrid`` requests with HTTP 403 ("not available for
your account and region"). The documented alternative is the Maps
JavaScript API — which has no export endpoint. The sanctioned capture path
(ADR-019 addendum #346) is therefore: the embedded picker *displays* the
map through the JS API exactly as rendered, the application captures those
pixels at the ``QWebEngineView`` level (``QWidget.grab()`` — no DOM access,
no tile scraping, no cross-origin canvas tricks), and the image is scaled
and cropped with the same analytic Web-Mercator math the Static path has
always used.

Issue #347 extends that single capture to a **pan grid**: the page pans the
map across a ``cols × rows`` grid of viewport positions at the same integer
zoom, Python grabs every frame, and stitches them — mirroring the Static
mosaic (which caps at 3x3). The Math in this module is the basis of both
the single-frame and the pan-grid choreography; the dialog runs one engine.

This module is Qt-free: it holds the pure math and image helpers so they
are unit-testable without a QApplication.

Measured facts behind the design (spike for #346):

- Google's satellite tile responses carry **no** ``Access-Control-Allow-
  Origin`` header and tile ``<img>`` elements **taint** a ``<canvas>`` —
  the html2canvas approach fails with a ``SecurityError`` on
  ``getImageData`` inside QtWebEngine 6.10. Widget-level grab is the only
  capture surface that works and it never sees the DOM (tile URLs embed
  the API key; keep them out of Python entirely).
- ``QWebEngineView.grab()`` returns real pixels at exactly
  ``css_size × devicePixelRatio``; verified at dpr 1.0 and 1.25.
- The analytic ``meters_per_pixel`` formula holds for integer zooms in the
  JS map (verified against ``map.getBounds()`` to ~0.03%).
- Subclassing ``QWebEnginePage`` to capture console messages hard-crashed
  QtWebEngine (0xC0000409) — never do that in production code.

Seam-free stitch theory (ADR-019 addendum #347): satellite tiles at an
integer zoom are *deterministic world-pixel content*. If two successive
frame centers differ by a whole number of css/world pixels, both frames are
exact adjacent windows of the same world image rendered at the same
sub-pixel phase (the center's fractional part is identical), so adjacent
grabs are identical along their shared edge. ``build_frame_layout``
therefore places centers on a whole-css-pixel grid, and stitches exactly at
``step × dpr`` offsets. To keep those offsets integral in *physical*
(grabbed) pixels, steps are aligned to the denominator of the dpr fraction
(``step × dpr`` whole). The residual sub-pixel behaviour of Google's own
rasterizer is the one assumption validated on a real key (manual checklist).
