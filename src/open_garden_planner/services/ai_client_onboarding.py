"""AI client onboarding (US-D1.6, generalized by issue #366): detect installed
MCP clients and register the Agent API server's connect URL into their config,
or hand back a copy-paste snippet when automatic registration isn't safe or
possible.

Qt-free (unit-testable without a GUI); the dialog is a thin shell over this
module.

**Clients are data, not control flow (issue #366).** A client used to be a
``Literal`` plus an ``if``/``elif`` chain through ``install_to_client`` and
``snippet_for_client``, so every new vendor meant a new branch in two places
and the only route for an *unknown* client was "Copy URL and paste it into a
chat" — which publishes the D2 write token into a transcript and produces
registrations that silently rot. Each client is now one frozen
:class:`ClientTarget` record in :data:`TARGETS`, and the three things that
actually differ between clients are three independent *fields* rather than
three branches:

* ``container_key`` — ``mcpServers`` (the JSON family) / ``mcp_servers`` (TOML)
  / ``mcp.servers`` (OpenCode, and NESTED). Three names for the same semantic
  model; the OpenCode spelling is known only by running its CLI, and its
  published schema does not say — see the ``opencode`` record below.
* ``syntax`` — ``json`` / ``jsonc`` / ``toml``, which selects a *serializer*
  strategy rather than a client branch.
* ``entry`` / ``cli_argv`` — the per-client entry shape and CLI, when it has one.
* ``cli_required_flags`` — whether the client **on this machine** is new enough
  for that argv. Measured per machine by :func:`cli_missing_capability`, because
  a machine can hold two generations of the same client and ``shutil.which``
  silently picks whichever comes first on ``PATH``. This is not a fourth axis
  of the client's *identity*; it is a fact about the binary that happens to be
  installed, and the owner's manual test is what proved it has to be asked.

The hard parts were never per-client: backup-before-write, atomic replace,
fail-closed on a file OGP does not own, and preserving foreign keys. Those live
once, in :func:`_merge_into_config`, and every syntax routes through it.

Per-client strategy, chosen from what each client's own docs support:

* **Cursor** — direct JSON merge into ``~/.cursor/mcp.json`` (documented flat
  ``mcpServers`` schema). OGP effectively owns this file, so a parse error may
  be recovered by replacing.
* **Claude Code** — ``claude mcp add --transport http --scope user`` via the
  CLI when it's on PATH (it validates its own writes and self-heals an existing
  entry); otherwise a direct atomic merge into the TOP-LEVEL ``mcpServers`` of
  ``~/.claude.json`` (the same user-scope location the CLI writes, read by both
  the CLI and the VS Code extension). The CLI is frequently NOT on PATH (e.g.
  the native ``~/.local/bin`` installer dir, or an extension-only install), so
  the direct-merge fallback is what makes one-click work without a terminal.
  The merge fails CLOSED on an unreadable ``~/.claude.json`` (it also holds
  OAuth / projects / trust) rather than replacing it.
* **OpenCode** — ``opencode mcp add <name> --url <url> --global`` when the
  installed CLI supports ``--global`` (entry ``{type: "remote", url, oauth:
  false}`` under ``mcp.servers``). **Two generations are supported**, because a
  machine can hold both and ``shutil.which`` picks whichever is first on
  ``PATH``: 1.18.x has no ``--global`` and stores servers FLAT as
  ``mcp.<name>``, so it gets ``legacy_cli_argv`` (identical minus the flag —
  which is safe *there*, because 1.18.x has no project config for ``mcp add`` at
  all and writes the user config by default) and ``legacy_container_key``. See
  :func:`cli_missing_capability` and ADR-035. **Without any usable CLI there is
  no merge**, by decision: its config is commented JSON that any merge would
  have to re-serialise whole, discarding the user's own comments, so the record
  sets ``merge_supported=False`` and registration refuses with an explanation
  plus the manual snippet. The config is a *commented* JSON variant that plain
  ``json.load()`` rejects, which is why the READER (:func:`_strip_jsonc`) is
  tolerant and the writer is not.
* **Codex** — ``codex mcp add <name> --url <url>`` when the CLI is on PATH;
  otherwise a **surgical TOML append** into ``~/.codex/config.toml``
  (container ``mcp_servers``). Surgical, not a re-serialise: ``tomllib`` reads
  and validates, and only the one table's line span is rewritten, so the user's
  own comments and formatting survive (issue #366 — a full ``tomli_w``-style
  rewrite of a file OGP does not own would destroy them).
* **Gemini CLI** — direct JSON merge into
  ``~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`` (same flat ``mcpServers`` shape as
  Cursor).
* **Claude Desktop** — detection only, and *cannot* connect to this server:
  Anthropic's connector UI reaches servers from its own cloud and rejects
  ``localhost`` / ``http://`` URLs, and ``claude_desktop_config.json`` is
  stdio-only. So OGP writes nothing here and the dialog redirects the user.

Every write path preserves unknown keys/other servers, backs up the original
file before touching it, and writes atomically (temp file + ``os.replace``) —
the first such pattern in this codebase (see ADR-035): every prior JSON writer
here does a bare ``open(path, "w")`` because it only ever writes *our own*
file. This module writes into files owned by *other* applications, so the bar
is higher.
