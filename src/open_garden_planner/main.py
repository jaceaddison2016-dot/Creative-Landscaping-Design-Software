    The pre-release exe smoke test only exercises startup; the 3D view's Qt3D
    bindings are imported lazily (ADR-038), so a Qt micro-version mismatch
    passes startup and only crashes when the user opens the 3D view. This
    imports every Qt3D binding the view uses — the DLL load + symbol resolution
    here is the EXACT failure surface of #277 — and checks the runtime Qt equals
    the Qt version the Qt3D wheels were built for. No window and no GL context,
    so it runs on a headless CI runner. Returns non-zero on any failure so a
    broken frozen build fails the release instead of shipping.

    A windowed (console=False) frozen exe is given no CONSOLE, so when it is
    launched detached -- `Start-Process -Wait -PassThru`, what CI does -- it has
    no stdout at all and the EXIT CODE is the only channel. Launched from a
    shell that redirects (a pipe), it *does* inherit a handle and the prints
    below are visible; that is the local/dev case.

    #
    # The 8-second exe smoke test only proves the app survives startup, which a
    # silently-dead subsystem passes. The Agent API server died in every
    # released windowed build because uvicorn's default log config calls
    # sys.stdout.isatty(), and a console=False frozen exe launched with no
    # inherited stdout handle has sys.stdout is None.
    #
    # Starting a real server here exercises the real failure surface in the
    # real artifact -- same reasoning as the Qt3D imports above (#277).
    #
    # But note WHICH launch reproduces #291, because this was stated wrongly for
    # a while (see the dated correction in section 11.4): `console=False` means
    # no console is ALLOCATED, not that stdout is unconditionally None. Run this
    # exe through a shell pipe and it inherits a real handle -- measured, ~300
    # bytes of the prints below reached stdout -- so `isatty()` answers and a
    # regression of the `log_config=None` fix would pass. Only a launch with no
    # inherited stdout handle (Start-Process, or a double-click) has
    # `sys.stdout is None`. The gate must use that form or it is testing the
