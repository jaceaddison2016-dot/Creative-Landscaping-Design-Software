"""Truth gates on the spike's REAL board: the bench plan through ``build_models`` (ADR-048, L0).

The builder tests in ``test_spike_q3d_meshes.py`` prove each builder in
isolation; these prove the pipeline the Beauty Board actually renders — the
showcase plan ``bench_small.ogp`` resolved, built and fitted exactly as the
spike does it, with a recording factory instead of the engine (no GPU):

* every built object's top IS its resolved height (±1 %), every plant's
  top − base IS its height (±3 %) — on the June AND the December build;
* an item the 2D shadow overlay casts nothing for casts nothing in 3D either;
* every flat face of every built model stores its winding normal;
* each shot shows the plan on its own sun date (the board loop, Qt-free).

``ogp-lush-cinematic`` §1 is the contract; the L0 review found each of these
broken on the board while the per-builder tests were green.

    the spike returned False on asparagus harvest dates at frost dates from 4 January
    on, and on rhubarb's from 1 January until just before the frost's anniversary
    (senior review, passes 5-9). The helper anchors the state on the date's own year.

    has no 29 February ("no window to read"). That expectation encoded the bug: a
    plan configured with a 29-February frost behaved as if it had none in non-leap
    years. The shared rule now substitutes 1 March, so a window exists in EVERY
