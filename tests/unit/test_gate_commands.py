"""One home for the frozen-exe gate command, and it must survive its shell.

Two rules, both born from real self-inflicted defects in PR #334.

**Rule 1 — the command literal lives in one place.** An early draft of this file
reacted to "eight documents prescribe a weaker gate" by copying the corrected
command into ten more, then guarding the copies with a hand-maintained list of
filenames. A reviewer named it: the response to *"a second copy of a gate list is
how a gate goes missing"* was to make eighteen copies. So the literals now live
only in :data:`SANCTIONED_HOMES` — the canonical definition
(``ogp-change-control`` §2.8), its mechanics (``ogp-build-and-run``) and the
copy-paste Quick Reference in the root instructions — and every other document
**cites** §2.8 by name. The CI workflow that actually runs the gate is checked
separately, on its own terms (see :data:`_RELEASE_WORKFLOW`).

**Rule 2 — wherever it does appear, it must work.** The command was wrong twice
in two commits:

* ``…OpenGardenPlanner.exe --selftest`` — PowerShell does not wait on a
  GUI-subsystem process; it returned in ~6 ms with an empty ``$LASTEXITCODE``.
  The gate passed unconditionally.
* ``powershell -Command "$p = Start-Process …; exit $p.ExitCode"`` — bash expands
  ``$`` inside double quotes, so PowerShell received
  ``= Start-Process …; exit .ExitCode``, threw two ``CommandNotFoundException``s
  and exited 1 without launching the exe. The gate failed unconditionally.

Measured by printing the child's ``argv``::

    outer double quotes -> [ = Start-Process 'x' -Wait -PassThru; exit .ExitCode]
    outer single quotes -> [$p = Start-Process "x" -Wait -PassThru; exit $p.ExitCode]

Every version of this guard was itself defeated, and each defeat is now a teeth
case: ``shlex.split`` modelled tokenisation but not expansion and passed on the
first defect; a ``$NAME``-only scanner was bypassed with PowerShell's ``$?``; and
substring checks for ``Start-Process``/``-Wait``/``-PassThru``/``exit`` were
bypassed by dropping the ``$p =`` assignment while keeping ``exit $p.ExitCode``,
which exits 0 whatever the child returned. Round 8 added three walkable
spellings of the discovery predicate — a quoted path at line start
(``"dist/…exe" --selftest``), ``powershell.exe``, and a prose word in a
trailing comment (``# the gate exists``) — plus the launcher-variant seam in
the shape checks. Each is now a teeth case.

Static by design: it does not run the gates (that needs a built exe and minutes
of wall clock). Issue #336 proposes a citation resolver for the skill library;
that checks references *resolve*, this checks commands *run*.
