"""Tests for the Companion panel's compatible-set action (US-D3.1, #319).

These pin the three defects the live manual pass found, none of which the
pre-existing suite could see because it never exercised the panel path:

* ``_get_current_bed_id`` / ``_get_bed_plants`` read ``parent_bed_id`` from
  ``item.metadata``, but it is a ``GardenItem`` PROPERTY — both returned None
  and the action silently did nothing.
* the action passed the whole bed as ``must_include``, which returns nothing
  unless the bed already IS a complete clique (P0-2).
* ``size=3`` returned an empty dialog for a two-plant bed.
