"""#415 — the propagation editor showed (and stored) step dates in the wrong year.

The detail panel's editor used to force each displayed propagation-step date
into ``datetime.date.today().year``, start and end independently, "for
readability". Consequences pinned here:

* a step in another calendar year silently moved into the current one;
* a step that crossed New Year was persisted **inverted** into the ``.ogp``
  (``start 2026-12-24 / end 2026-01-22``);
* an edit therefore changed a year the user never touched.

Parametrised over the year and over leap/non-leap, because the defect is exactly
0 for a step that happens to sit inside the current year and the 29-February
corners only exist in some years — the default case proves nothing (the same
discipline as #213 / PR #217).

Qt-free: this file drives :func:`compute_propagation_plan` and the editor's
populate/commit logic directly. The widget-level end-to-end case lives in
``tests/integration/test_propagation_editor_years.py``.
