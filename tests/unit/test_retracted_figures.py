"""Documented figures must be the figures the committed harnesses produce.

**Why this exists.** Seven review rounds each found a documented number that the
code contradicts: `2,669`, `1 of 64` / `10 of 54`, garlic "two months early" (the
direction was wrong), `1.0-1.5x`, "317 previously-unrun statements now covered",
the third-vs-fourth "offset to date" count, `(2,190 cases)6`. The retractions are
all in the git history; nothing prevented them being written.

**What this guard is.** It re-runs the two committed measurement harnesses, parses
what they printed, and fails if a document quotes a number in a *known shape* that
the harness did not produce. It exercises a function, so it survives refactoring
and it moves with the data.

**What this guard is deliberately not.** An earlier version also carried a
hand-typed table of retracted strings (`RETRACTED`) plus two test classes that
scanned documents for them. Round 7's objection was correct: that mechanism
"cannot catch a *new* wrong figure, which is the failure mode that actually produced
six rounds of findings — every one of those is a fresh false claim in a document,
and the guard was green through all of them because none of them is in the table."
A list of strings someone typed guards against re-pasting a *known* wrong string
and costs real maintenance. It is deleted.

The hole that leaves is narrow and worth stating plainly: a wrong figure in a
**brand-new shape** — nobody has ever written "1.0-1.5x" before, so no pattern
covers it. That is much smaller than "only figures I already knew about", and it
is not closable by a static check at all.
