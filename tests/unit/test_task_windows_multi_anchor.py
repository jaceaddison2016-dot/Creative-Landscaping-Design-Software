"""#414 — every GUI task surface must see the windows the agent already saw.

The Tasks tab, the planting-calendar dashboard and the Gantt each anchored their
frost-relative windows on the **current year's** last spring frost, while the
agent's ``get_tasks`` / ``get_task_calendar`` (``generate_for_date_window``)
anchored on every year whose frost can reach the requested dates. So a window
anchored on another year's frost appeared in the agent and on no GUI surface:

* a 20 September frost put a tomato harvest at 29 Nov 2026 – 7 Feb 2027, which
  the Tasks tab and dashboard dropped entirely on 1 January 2027 — a
  tomato-only plan then read "No tasks — you're all caught up." while the task
  was open;
* a 15 February frost put broad-bean sowing at 21 Dec 2026 – 18 Jan 2027, not
  listed before 1 January;
* a 9 April frost put garlic's autumn sowing (9–23 Oct 2026) on no GUI surface.

The measurement itself is **not** this file. It is
`scripts/measure_task_window_sweep.py`, which prints every figure quoted in ADR-029, §11.4, the roadmap and
CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md: over the 64 bundled species that carry calendar offsets x 6
frost dates x every 10th day of 2026 (222 cases), **1,849 missed (task, frost
date, day) cases before the fix, 0 after, with 0 listed that the agent did not
list**. The absolute count is harness-dependent — all 118 species on every day of 2026 (2,190 cases) gives 18,007 before / 0 after — so quote the harness with the number.

What THIS file pins is the invariant, on a smaller fixture: `agent <= gui` and
`gui <= agent` over two hand-written species (GARLIC, TOMATO) x 6 frost dates x
every 15th day, i.e. it fails if either surface hides a task the other can see.

Qt-free, so the sweep is cheap: the GUI's listing rule is
``classify_urgency(...) is not None`` applied to the shared generator's output,
which is exactly what the widgets do (invariant: both sides read the same
function). The widget-level counterpart is
``tests/integration/test_task_windows_multi_anchor.py``.

    actionable yet, and the GUI must not be blamed for that.
