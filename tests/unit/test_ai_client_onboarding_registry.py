"""Unit tests for the generalized onboarding registry (issue #366).

Covers what the refactor made possible and what it must NOT have weakened:
the three syntax strategies (``json`` / ``jsonc`` / surgical ``toml``), the
read-only/write URL split that closes the token-in-a-transcript leak, and
stale-registration detection.

The pre-existing suite in ``test_ai_client_onboarding.py`` is the regression net
for the refactor itself: all 49 of its tests still pass, and they pin the
pre-#366 contract. Three of its assertions changed, and honestly so — the
``install_method`` value ``"json_merge"`` is now ``"merge"``, because the old
name was already a lie for the TOML and JSONC targets and this change's whole
thesis is that syntax is a separate axis; and a CLI failure now prefixes which
command failed, because a client that rejects its arguments answers with its
entire help text and the dialog renders this string in a one-line status label.
