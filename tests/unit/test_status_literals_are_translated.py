"""Every string delivered to the status bar must be translatable — and registered.

This is the guard that should have caught two P0s and did not.

* `offset_tool.py`'s ``"Created {dir} offset of {dist:.1f} cm"`` — wrapped in
  ``self._view.tr(...)``, which pylupdate6 cannot extract because it only walks
  ``self.tr`` inside QObject subclasses.
* `canvas_scene.py`'s three calibration strings — **bare literals**, not wrapped in
  anything. Round 6's scan looked only at ``tr()`` literals, so a bare literal was
  structurally invisible to it.

Both shipped English to a German user. Both were dead until this branch fixed
``CanvasView.set_status_message`` (which reached for ``self.parent().statusBar()``
and so resolved to nothing in the production layout, where the canvas's parent is
a ``QSplitter``). Fixing the route made two dozen previously-silent strings
user-visible at once, and two of them were not translatable.

Why this shape and not a list of strings: a hand-maintained table cannot catch a
*newly written* wrong string, which is exactly how six review rounds' worth of
documentation defects survived green suites. This walks the call sites, so it
fails the moment someone writes a bare literal — regardless of what it says.

`test_german_ts_has_no_unfinished` cannot help here: it inspects messages already
in the table, and a string that was never registered is by definition not in it.
That is the same blind spot AGENTS.md records for plain-string call sites.

**What is and is not decidable.** A static walk can settle three shapes, and this
checks all three:

1. a literal argument (``set_status_message("…")``);
2. a translation followed by ``.format()`` / ``.replace()`` — the pattern AGENTS.md
   prescribes, and which is easy to mistake for a bare literal;
3. a **local variable**, resolved to its assignments in the enclosing function —
   ``chamfer_tool.py`` builds its message this way, so a guard that only looked at
   the argument would either pass it by luck or flag it falsely.

An attribute or subscript (``cmd.description``) is not statically decidable: the
string's origin is in another module. Those are reported by
``test_the_undecidable_call_sites_are_known`` so the blind spot is visible rather
than invisible, but they do not fail the build — failing on them would be a guard
that cries wolf.

An **empty** argument is also allowed: ``set_status_message("")`` is the
clear-the-bar idiom (``canvas_scene.py`` uses it to dismiss the calibration
prompt), not an untranslated string. There is nothing to translate and nothing to
leak, and flagging it would be a false positive that teaches people to ignore
this guard.
