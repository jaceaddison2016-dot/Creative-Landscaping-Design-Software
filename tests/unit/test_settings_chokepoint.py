"""Gate: ``app/settings.create_qsettings()`` is the only settings-store factory.

Issue #285, ADR-041. #283 measured what an escape hatch costs: ``UiStateStore``
built its own ``QSettings`` for the real ``cofade / Open Garden Planner`` key, so
the conftest isolation — which only knew about ``AppSettings`` — did not cover
it, and every full-app test read *and overwrote* the developer's own window
state (120 writes from one test file). Fixing that one store is not the repair;
the repair is that a *new* store cannot repeat it.

Three rules, over ``src/``, ``tests/`` **and** ``scripts/`` (the incident was
observed from the test side, and a stray store in a test — or in a dev script,
which no conftest isolates — leaks exactly as hard):

1. Only ``app/settings.py`` may name ``QSettings`` at all — import it, annotate
   with it, or construct it. Everything else takes a store from the factory.
   Three test modules are exempt for stated reasons, and a test fails if an
   exemption stops being needed (the other direction — "nobody adds a fourth" —
   is a review duty, not something a check in this file could honestly enforce).
2. Nobody may call ``QSettings.setDefaultFormat()`` / ``setPath()``: those are
   process-global statics Qt never reverts (§11.4 — a leaked ``setPath`` to a
   deleted ``tmp_path`` once broke six unrelated tests two-thirds of the way
   through a session).
3. Nobody *should* build a store at **import time** — not via
   ``create_qsettings()`` and not via any wrapper that owns one
   (``AppSettings``, ``UiStateStore``, ``get_settings``), at module scope, in a
   class body, in a decorator, in a default argument or in an annotation. Note
   the weaker verb: this rule is **belt-and-braces**, not what makes the test
   isolation hold. ``tests/conftest.py`` rebinds the factory's org/app names at
   its own *import* time (module scope, not in a fixture), and pytest imports the
   root conftest before any test module — so even an import-time store is built
   after the redirection and lands in the test key. What the rule still buys: a
   store constructed at import time can be redirected by *nothing* afterwards (a
   ``QSettings`` binds its organization/application at construction), so it is a
   latent trap for any other isolation scheme and a smell in its own right.

The scan is an AST walk, not a regex, and every detector has a positive control
in ``TestDetectorsCatchKnownEscapes`` — fed the exact escape it exists to catch.
Both disciplines were bought the hard way, one review at a time: a line-anchored
regex missed ``from PyQt6.QtCore import (\n    QSettings as _Q,\n)`` (the class is
named on a line with no ``import`` keyword), and a first cut of rule 3 matched
only the literal name ``create_qsettings`` — so a module-level ``AppSettings()``,
which is what a developer would actually write, sailed straight through the gate
named after that very invariant. Falsify against the API people use, not the
primitive the gate is written in terms of.
