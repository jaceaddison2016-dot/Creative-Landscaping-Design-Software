"""#398 — skill prose must not contradict the repository it describes.

Agent skills are loaded *before* an agent touches CI, the Agent API or an ADR, so
a stale statement in them is acted on as fact. The audit found four that the code
contradicted: the CI job count ("Three parallel jobs" while `ci.yml` had four),
a second copy of the same error in the QA skill, "no token auth on the loopback
Agent API" (superseded for writes by US-D2.0/ADR-036), and an ADR range written
as "ADR-001…ADR-034" while the file carried ADR-046.

`scripts/check_skill_citations.py` resolves identifiers (§N.M, ADR-0NN,
path:line) but is structurally blind to **counts and negations** — "no auth",
"three jobs" — because those are prose, not citations. This file is the drift
guard for exactly that blind spot: it derives the facts from the real sources and
compares them with the prose.

Each check below failed on `84ead2e` before the #398 corrections.
