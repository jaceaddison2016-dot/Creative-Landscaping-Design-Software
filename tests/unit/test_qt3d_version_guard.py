"""Regression guard for issue #277 — the Qt3D wheels must be built for the
SAME Qt micro as the core Qt runtime, or Qt3DCore fails to import in a frozen
build and the 3D view silently kills the process when the user opens it.

Root cause: pyproject hard-pinned PyQt6-3D-Qt6 but left PyQt6-Qt6 free to
float, so a fresh CI resolve mixed Qt6Core.dll 6.11.1 with Qt3D DLLs built for
6.11.0. Under the hard ``==`` pins nothing floats, so on a normal CI run this
is belt-and-suspenders — its value is narrow but real: it fires the moment a
maintainer edits ONE pin out of step and CI reinstalls. It imports NO Qt3D
module (only metadata + qVersion), so it needs no display or GL context and is
safe on the offscreen CI runner. The layer that actually guards the SHIPPED
artifact against any resolution surprise is the frozen-exe ``--selftest`` in
release.yml — this one guards the source pins.
