"""#416 — what the bundled harvest offsets actually mean, and what they don't.

``models/plant_data.py`` documented ``harvest_start`` as "weeks after planting".
Every reader has always counted it from the plan's **last spring frost** —
``services/task_generator.generate_calendar_tasks``, the planting calendar's
Gantt, the agent's ``get_tasks`` / ``get_task_calendar``, and the Phase 17 spike's
fruit window. This file pins the semantics that the code actually implements.

It also records, as data rather than as a silent assumption, how far the bundled
rows diverge from ``days_to_maturity``. The measurement is committed as
``scripts/measure_harvest_offsets.py`` (118 species, 64 with both harvest offsets
and a maturity range):

* reading **A** — frost-relative, ``harvest_start x 7`` inside the maturity range,
  which is what every reader actually implements: **38 fit / 26 miss**;
* reading **B** — planting-relative, ``(harvest_start - planting_offset) x 7``
  inside the range ± 15 %: **45 fit / 19 miss**;
* **11 species fit neither** (basil, bush bean, Brussels sprouts, echinacea,
  oregano, radish, rocket, rosemary, spinach, sweet pea, zucchini).

Two conclusions, and the distinction is the whole point of #416:

* **Both readings fit a majority, so the data is not irreconcilable.** An earlier
  draft of this file claimed "1 fits / 63 miss" and "10 fits / 54 miss" and used
  the absence of a majority to justify deferring the conversion. Those numbers
  matched no harness and the conclusion was wrong — the senior review caught it.
* **Reading B fits more often than the one the code implements.** So the rows were
  probably *authored* as planting-relative while every reader counts them from the
  frost. That is a real, separate finding, and it is what makes the row conversion
  a package rather than a patch.

The shipped half of #416 is therefore to make the documentation true and to name
the divergence. The row conversion is deferred to #418 on the grounds that it
needs a cited horticultural source per row and licence clearance under #311's
provenance rules — **not** because the data cannot be reconciled.
``days_to_maturity`` is reference data that no computation reads (asserted
below), so correcting rows cannot move a computed date.

The named exceptions below are a drift guard: adding or reordering a bundled
species that changes this set must be a deliberate act, not a silent diff.
