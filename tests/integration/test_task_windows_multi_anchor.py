"""#414 end-to-end: the GUI task surfaces list the multi-year anchored windows.

The Qt-free sweep in ``tests/unit/test_task_windows_multi_anchor.py`` pins the
generation logic (measured over 64 bundled species and 222 frost-date/day
cases: **1,849** (task, frost date, day) cases missed on master, **0** after).
This file drives the real widgets — ``TasksView`` and the planting calendar's
dashboard and Gantt — because the bug was partly that each surface built its own
list instead of consuming the shared engine.

Observed failing on master before the fix:

* the Tasks tab dropped a tomato harvest running 29 Nov 2026 – 7 Feb 2027 on
  1 January 2027 (a tomato-only plan read "No tasks — you're all caught up.");
* the dashboard omitted it too;
* the Gantt recomputed its bars from the current year's frost, so a window
  anchored on another year had no bar at all.
