"""Issue #365: ``new_plan`` / ``open_plan`` over the REAL MCP transport.

Why this file exists separately from ``test_agent_api_default_on.py`` (which
covers the same tools at the main-thread-body level): both tools originally
returned ``ExportResult(**result)`` while their providers returned a dict with
no ``format`` key and a ``None`` ``file_path`` against a ``str`` field. So both
raised a pydantic ``ValidationError`` on **every successful call over the
wire** — while all 22 body-level tests passed, because the body never builds
the result model. Only the transport crosses that boundary.

The lesson is general: a tool's declared return model is a contract, and
testing the provider is not the same as testing the tool. These are per-tool
tests, honestly described — they cover the two models #365 added, not every
model in the server. (Enumerating every ``X(**result)`` site in ``server.py``
against its model's required fields found no other live tool in violation, so
the remaining models are covered by the existing transport suites.)
