"""The test harness must never touch the user's real settings store (issue #285).

This is the end-to-end half of #285: build the whole application, exercise the
settings paths it runs at startup and shutdown, and prove every read and write
landed in the isolated test store.

Why a full-app test and not a unit assertion: the escape hatch #283 found was
invisible at unit level. ``AppSettings`` was isolated and looked fine; the leak
was ``UiStateStore``, reached only through ``GardenPlannerApp``'s constructor
(``_restore_ui_state``) and its ``closeEvent`` (``_save_ui_state``), which
pytest-qt triggers at teardown for every registered widget. Measured
consequence: 40 teardowns x 3 keys = 120 writes into the developer's own
registry from one test file, and a #283 assertion that failed *with* the fix
applied because a stale real-world toolbar layout was the actual variable.

The spy records Python-level access only — which is the entire surface this app
uses. Access from inside Qt's own C++ (a native dialog remembering its last
directory, say) is neither visible here nor this project's to control.
