# Open Garden Planner - Instructions for Coding Agents

PyQt6 desktop app for precision garden planning with CAD-like metric accuracy.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Run app
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m open_garden_planner

# Run tests
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/ -v

# Lint
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff check src/

# Security scan
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m bandit -r src/ --severity-level high

# Build & verify exe (before every merge) — BOTH checks
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m PyInstaller installer/ogp.spec --noconfirm
timeout 8 dist/OpenGardenPlanner/OpenGardenPlanner.exe
# Exit code 124 (killed by timeout) = success
powershell -Command '$p = Start-Process "dist/OpenGardenPlanner/OpenGardenPlanner.exe" -ArgumentList "--selftest" -Wait -PassThru; exit $p.ExitCode'
# Exit code 0 = Qt3D bindings import, the Qt runtime matches the Qt3D wheel
# version (the check that caught #277), AND the Agent API server binds.
# The 8-s smoke only proves the process stays up; --selftest is what sees a
# silently-dead subsystem (#291 hid from the smoke for six releases). Must be
# Start-Process -Wait -PassThru: PowerShell does not wait on a GUI-subsystem
# exe, and a shell-piped run hands it a real stdout so it cannot reproduce the
# no-inherited-handle condition #291 needs.

# Update & compile translations (after adding/changing any UI strings)
PYTHONUTF8=1 venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/fill_translations.py
PYTHONUTF8=1 venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/compile_translations.py
# pytest tests/unit/test_i18n.py::TestTranslationFiles::test_german_ts_has_no_unfinished
# verifies zero unfinished strings — fails if any string was missed

## Debugging

**Use `/debug-verbose` at the first sign of any non-obvious bug — before theorising.**

The skill instruments the relevant code with `print`-based logging (stdout, no config needed), then the bug is reproduced manually and the output is read. Fix from evidence, not assumptions.

Key rules:
- Always include `traceback.format_stack()` at "unexpected call" sites — this is what reveals external callers (e.g. the minimap hiding the label editor).
- Prefix every print with `[TAG]` so output is grep-able.
- Remove all instrumentation before committing; the fix stays, the prints don't.
- After each fix, add a **Case study** entry to the `debug-verbose` skill in both agent skill libraries (symptom, wrong theories, key log line, root cause, lesson). The skill grows with the project.

## Documentation & Knowledge Base

Architecture documentation follows arc42 in `docs/`. This project uses **continuous documentation** — every feature and fix should leave the docs better than found.

### Skill Library (`.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`)

Claude Code or Codex auto-loads each skill's `name` + `description` and invokes it via the
Skill tool when a task matches. **The authoritative trigger for each skill is its
frontmatter `description`** — this table is a routing map, not a substitute. Reach
for a skill *before* acting, not after. Three pre-existing skills (`debug-verbose`,
`finalize-us`, `analyze-pr`) plus the `senior-reviewer` agent are documented elsewhere
in this file; the `deliver-package` workflow skill and the 19 `ogp-*` skills below cover
the rest. The 3D agents `ogp-3d-creator` (builds) and `ogp-3d-reviewer` (judges) serve step 7.

| Skill | Reach for it when… |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| `deliver-package` | taking on a whole cluster of issues at once ("take the next package", "pick the next issues and implement them", "deliver package N") — ground truth → choose → implement → gates → senior-review → draft PR |
| `ogp-change-control` | starting any change, branching, opening/merging a PR, versioning, or unsure whether an action is allowed |
| `ogp-architecture-contract` | designing a feature, adding a module, or touching serialization / undo / layers / beds / agent_api — "is this allowed architecturally?" |
| `ogp-failure-archaeology` | about to change a subsystem with history, or tempted to "fix" code that looks wrong (it may be a scar) |
| `ogp-debugging-playbook` | a bug is reported, a test fails unexpectedly, CI is red while local is green, or a canvas/export glitch appears |
| `ogp-qt-cad-reference` | touching canvas items, coordinates/Y-flip, rendering/export, rotation/resize, snapping/constraints, handles, or Qt tests |
| `ogp-garden-domain-reference` | touching species / beds / soil / tasks / calendar / harvest / companion logic, or decoding a diagnostic or domain term |
| `ogp-config-and-flags` | adding/changing a setting or flag, configuring env, or a feature seems mysteriously disabled |
| `ogp-build-and-run` | setting up the env, running the app or tests, building the exe/installer, or an import/build error appears |
| `ogp-diagnostics-and-tooling` | you need to MEASURE instead of eyeball — quality gates, live-plan inspection, mojibake, git archaeology |
| `ogp-validation-and-qa` | writing tests, deciding if work is "done", preparing a PR, or judging whether evidence suffices |
| `ogp-docs-and-writing` | finishing any feature/fix and owing doc updates, writing an ADR/FR/§11.4 entry, or unsure where knowledge lives |
| `ogp-external-positioning` | writing README/release notes, adding a dependency/service, licensing questions, or any public capability claim |
| `ogp-3d-sunshade-campaign` | starting or resuming Phase 14 (3D, sun/shade, shadows, height property, solar math) |
| `ogp-proof-and-analysis-toolkit` | about to assert a library/geometry/tolerance/coordinate-frame fact — "prove it, don't just install it" |
| `ogp-research-frontier` | picking the next big direction, or scoping D2/D3 / Phase-14+ ambitions |
| `ogp-research-methodology` | starting an investigation, forming a hypothesis, or deciding whether evidence suffices to adopt a change |
| `ogp-asset-forge` | adding/regenerating a texture or 2D art asset — house style, tileability gate, provenance rules (US-E9) |
| `ogp-lush-cinematic` | building or judging anything visible in 3D (Phase 17) — truth gates, style values, light rigs, Beauty Board, rubric, owner taste log |
| `ogp-3d-renderer` | touching Qt Quick 3D code, hosts, picking, screenshots, CI rendering or packaging — measured engine facts and traps |

**Maintaining this table:** add a one-line row when a new skill lands; keep the real
trigger in the skill's `description`. If a row and a `description` disagree, the
`description` wins — fix the row.

References inside skill files are gated (§8.10) — keep them resolvable:

```bash
venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_skill_citations.py
```

### Claude/Codex context parity

`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are a synchronized pair. If either file changes, update
both in the same change. Project-owned skills must exist in both `.claude/skills/` and
`.agents/skills/`; the native senior-reviewer definitions must stay aligned in
`.claude/agents/` and `.codex/agents/`. Run the read-only parity gate before opening or
closing a PR:

```bash
venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_agent_context.py
```

Host-provided skills and local settings remain ignored. The gate intentionally reports
drift instead of overwriting either agent's native file format.

### Contributing to Documentation

**After implementing a feature:**
| Change Type | Update Target |
|-------------|---------------|
| New component/module | `docs/05-building-block-view/` — add black box description |
| New UI pattern | `docs/08-crosscutting-concepts/` section 8.9 |
| Changed runtime behavior | `docs/06-runtime-view/` — update sequence diagrams |
| New user-facing capability | `docs/functional-requirements.md` — add FR-* entry |
| Architecture decision | `docs/09-architecture-decisions/` — create ADR |
| New domain term | `docs/12-glossary/` — add definition |

**After solving issues, all lessons learned MUST be documented:**
| Issue Category | Document In | Capture |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| PyQt6 quirks | `docs/11-risks-and-technical-debt/` 11.4 | Symptoms → Root cause → Fix |
| Performance issues | `docs/08-crosscutting-concepts/` | Optimization technique |
| Testing patterns | `docs/08-crosscutting-concepts/` 8.10 | How to test this pattern |
| Security fixes | `docs/08-crosscutting-concepts/` 8.11 | Vulnerability + mitigation |

**ADR triggers:** Create ADR when introducing new dependencies, choosing between approaches, changing patterns, or addressing non-obvious constraints.

**Before merge, verify:** arc42 docs updated, ADRs created if needed, glossary updated, wiki synced.

## Versioning Protocol

**GitHub releases are THE source of truth.** CI auto-creates tags/releases on non-chore push to master.

```bash
# Find current version:
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" release list --limit 1 --json tagName --jq '.[0].tagName'
```

- CI **defaults to patch** bump
- Add `minor` or `major` **label** to PR for bigger bumps
- After merge, update both `pyproject.toml` and `src/open_garden_planner/__init__.py` to match the CI release
- Push as `chore:` commit (CI skips these)

**Never create git tags manually.**

## Plan Mode

**Avoid the recurring "File has not been read yet" Write failure on the plan file.**
Plan mode pre-creates the plan file, so `Write` (and `Edit`) reject it until it's been read this
session. Build the plan with the **`Edit`** tool (incremental edits — what plan mode tells you to
do). If you must overwrite it wholesale, **`Read` the plan file once first, then `Write`.** Never
`Write`/`Edit` a pre-existing file blind — the same rule applies to any file you didn't create this session.

## Workflow

**CRITICAL: Always use feature branches — NEVER commit directly to master.**

> **MUST — every coding job ends with a draft PR.** Any task that changes code (feature, bug fix, refactor, doc-in-code, chore) finishes by pushing the branch and opening a **draft** pull request — never leave the work as just a pushed branch. Open the draft only **after** the `senior-reviewer` pass is fully satisfied (no outstanding P0/P1) — or, if the pass genuinely cannot be run, with the unmet gate stated in the PR body and no move toward merge (`ogp-change-control` §2.4). The PR stays a **draft** until the user confirms manual testing passed; only then mark it ready and merge. Do NOT open a non-draft PR or merge without explicit user confirmation.

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/US-X.X-short-description` | Before any changes |
| 2 | Read user story from `docs/roadmap.md` | Understand acceptance criteria |
| 3 | Implement with type hints & translation | Use `self.tr()` for all UI strings |
| 4 | Run quality checks | `pytest tests/ -v`, `ruff check src/`, `bandit -r src/ --severity-level high` |
| 4a | Update translations | Add strings to `scripts/fill_translations.py`, run `PYTHONUTF8=1 venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/fill_translations.py` then `compile_translations.py`; `pytest tests/unit/test_i18n.py::TestTranslationFiles::test_german_ts_has_no_unfinished` must pass |
| 5 | **Write integration test** in `tests/integration/test_<feature>.py` | **Mandatory** — end-to-end UI workflow. See `docs/08-crosscutting-concepts/` 8.10 |
| 6 | Build & verify exe | See Quick Reference |
| 7 | **Run senior-reviewer pass** | Launch the `senior-reviewer` agent in a fresh worktree against the branch diff. Address any P0/P1 findings before proceeding. Re-run after fixes for a clean re-review. The `finalize-us` skill repeats this step pre-PR. A change visible in 3D first passes `ogp-3d-creator` → `ogp-3d-reviewer` with no P0/P1. |
| 8 | Provide testing checklist | Surface a manual-testing checklist alongside the work |
| 9 | Commit: `feat(US-X.X): Description` | Conventional commit format |
| 10 | Push & **open DRAFT PR** | After a clean senior-reviewer pass, push and open a **draft** PR automatically (`pr create --draft`). **Every coding job ends here — never stop at just a pushed branch.** Keep it a draft and **do NOT merge** until the user confirms manual testing passed — only then mark ready (`pr ready`) and `pr merge --squash --delete-branch --admin` |
| 11 | Sync version on master | See Versioning Protocol (after merge) |
| 12 | `/clear` context | Clear Agent context

## Translation (i18n)

> **MUST — every feature, no exceptions.** Every user-visible string added in any file MUST be wrapped for translation. Skipping this is a bug.

- `QWidget`/`QDialog` subclasses → `self.tr("string")`
- `QGraphicsItem` context menus (non-QObject) → `QCoreApplication.translate("ClassName", "string")`
- Module-level dicts → `QT_TR_NOOP("string")`, translate later with `QCoreApplication.translate()`
- `CollapsiblePanel(title)` → wrap at the **call site**, not inside the panel
- **Hardcoded English f-strings (`f"{a} overlaps {b}"`) bypass `tr()` and never reach Qt Linguist** — use `self.tr("{a} overlaps {b}").format(a=…, b=…)`. The `test_german_ts_has_no_unfinished` test only catches MISSING translations of REGISTERED strings; it cannot see plain-string call sites. Pattern: if it's user-visible text, it MUST go through `tr()` / `QT_TR_NOOP` / `QCoreApplication.translate()` — registering it in `scripts/fill_translations.py` alone is insufficient.
- **NEVER use PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8`** for files with non-ASCII (umlauts etc.) — double-encodes UTF-8 into mojibake. Use the `Edit` tool or Python `open(..., encoding="utf-8")`.

Full how-to (step-by-step, `.ts` format, recompile command): see `docs/08-crosscutting-concepts/` section 8.3.

## Testing Notes

- PyQt6 tests require `qtbot` fixture even when unused (needed for Qt init); ruff per-file ignore ARG002 in test files

## Where to Pick Up After Restart

- **Serialization & data integrity hardening shipped 2026-10-06 as v1.29.4 (PR #412): #394 + #400 + #397 + #403.** (Epic #392). Free-text annotations (`TextItem`) natively serialized in `.ogp` (AUD-001/017) with round-trip matrix tests across all placeable items; clipboard serializer unified by delegating `CanvasView` copy/paste to `ProjectManager` (AUD-002); background image placeholders & recursive UUID deduplication (AUD-043); two-phase atomic plan loading & autosave safety (AUD-040). See §11.3, §11.4.
- **i18n blind-spot fixes shipped 2026-10-04 as v1.29.2 (PR #411): #393 + #408 + #410.** Three display-string defects invisible to `test_german_ts_has_no_unfinished`: five duplicate `TRANSLATIONS` keys shadowed 62 strings (the 5 German PDF journal-notes strings were never registered); generated soil-amendment task titles stayed English (the **id** keeps the English data name so saved done/snooze status survives a language switch); and the agent `suggest_companions` `name` now follows the UI language. One shared `app/settings.py::active_language()` now backs every former per-module language helper; CI lint widened to `ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/` (238 pre-existing errors cleaned up) with an `ast` uniqueness test. See §11.4, §8.19, ADR-045 addendum.
- Phases 1–12, Phase 13 (Packages A–D), and Phases 14 and 15 (Visual Refresh, Packages 1–3) are complete. Package D finished in v1.29.1 via PR #382.
- **Phase 17 "Living Garden 3D" is at Package L0 — complete with a GO** (owner decision 2026-10-05, ADR-048 *Accepted*): Qt Quick 3D replaces Qt 3D. The dormant spike lives in `src/open_garden_planner/spike_q3d/` behind `--spike-q3d`; ADR-048's evidence log (entry 19 = the owner-GPU run) records the measurements, and the temporary evidence tooling (`spike-q3d.yml`, `scripts/spike_q3d_ci.py`, its verdict test) is deleted with the decision. Next is **L1** ([#385](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/385)); criterion 3 chose the `QQuickView` host, and criterion 10's D3D11 leak half is accepted open until L1.3's A/B soak plus a dedicated-GPU-memory reading. Load `ogp-lush-cinematic` and `ogp-3d-renderer` before touching it. The shipped Qt 3D view (`ogp-3d-sunshade-campaign`) remains the product until L1 lands.
- Remaining work is tracked in `docs/roadmap.md`. **Package D is complete** (D3.3/D3.4, #332/#333, v1.29.1, PR #382, closing #237). Next are the permapeople-research Packages F (#312–#316, #312 first) and G (#320 only; G1–G3 shipped in v1.28.1 via PR #368); #319 is D3 and #321 is standalone touch input, despite the contiguous numbering. Load-bearing rules from the shipped D2 and Phase 15 work (details in the cited ADRs and §11.4): `ui/canvas/geometry_apply.py` is **the one apply path for every rect-backed resize; do not add another closure** (§8.19); `CanvasScene.clear()` is the one chokepoint that drops every private item-tracking list before the C++ teardown (#337); `ui/canvas/arrange.py::build_arrange_command` is the one apply path for every arrange surface, and the per-layer z-refresh never writes a `stack_order` rank (ADR-043, §8.25); satellite capture is ADR-019 with addenda #346/#347; `release.yml` attests build provenance, which is not Authenticode signing (ADR-044, §11.1/§11.2).
- The post-D2.4/D2.5 hardening package (#353/#354/#355) shipped in v1.27.10 via PR #360: same-scene document cleanup and fail-closed deletes, authenticated global MCP `undo`/`redo`, bounded callout offsets, and a repeated-median spatial-index guard. D2.6 (#330) completed the D2 tool layer in v1.27.11 via PR #361; next are D3 (#319, #331–#333) and Packages F/G. Follow-ups raised by that PR's manual pass: #364 (HOUSE roof-ridge drift — the sync re-projects instead of recomputing and the change is not undoable, so the error persists into the saved `.ogp`; pre-existing, also hit by GUI vertex drags), #365 (`new_plan` / `open_plan` plus the agreed policy reversal to agent-writable layer lock, which overturns FR-AGENT-17), and #362 (`get_history`).
- Read the relevant roadmap section before starting work, then check `git status` and `git log --oneline -20`.
- **#365 and #366 shipped in v1.28.0 via PR #367** (owner manual test passed). #366 rewrites `services/ai_client_onboarding.py` around a frozen `ClientTarget` registry — clients are **data**, so the dialog gained **OpenCode, Codex, and Gemini CLI** with no vendor-specific code beyond one completeness-tested per-client note — and makes the **read-only connect URL the default hand-out**, because the single "Copy URL" button used to copy the *write-enabled* URL, which is how a live write credential ended up pasted into a chat. Three serializers keyed on `syntax`; **TOML is appended surgically** (no `tomli-w`: a full re-serialise would destroy the user's own comments in a file OGP does not own) and **JSONC needs a tolerant reader**, or a commented `opencode.jsonc` fails closed into a dead end. **A client CLI is capability-probed, never assumed**: two OpenCode generations are in the wild (1.18.x has no `--global` and stores servers flat as `mcp.<name>`; 2.x has both) and one machine can hold both, so `cli_required_flags` asks the binary what it advertises and the probe is **tri-state** — an *indeterminate* answer refuses rather than guessing, because the wrong guess writes a project config into the working directory. #365 adds token-gated `new_plan` / `open_plan`, both reusing the GUI's own paths (extracted as `_new_project_document` and a raising `_load_project_file`), and reverses the layer-lock policy. **Read ADR-035's #366 addendum and ADR-034's #365 addendum before touching either area** — both record decisions that are not obvious from the code, including a reversal (an earlier "refuse an old CLI" decision was undone, because it removed a button that worked) and two things deliberately left unchanged (OpenCode's 5 s timeout, and the token still riding the URL rather than a header, because header transmission on tool calls is unmeasured).
- **D3.1 (#319) and D2.7 (#362) shipped 2026-09-29 as v1.28.2 via PR #370** (owner manual test passed). **PR #369 was closed** during this work's credential remediation, and #370 is the PR that shipped — if you find #369 referenced anywhere, it is the dead predecessor, not the shipped PR. That incident also produced `scripts/check_no_secrets.py` (see (e) below), which is now a CI gate. #319 adds the first domain-intelligence tools — `suggest_companions` / `find_compatible_sets` / `find_sets_for_bed` / `check_placement`, the `plan-polyculture-bed` prompt, and a Companion-panel "Suggest a compatible set…" action. `find_sets_for_bed` is the one that answers "what should I plant in this bed?"; `find_compatible_sets` searches a candidate palette you name and is the wrong tool for a bed already planted. #362 adds `get_history`, which makes two of D2's core undo invariants machine-checkable with no human reading the Edit menu. **Three things in this package are load-bearing and are easy to get wrong again:** (a) `parent_bed_id` is a `GardenItem` **property**, not a key in `item.metadata` — reading the dict silently returns nothing and the panel action opens an empty dialog; (b) **never pass a bed's plants as `must_include`** to the clique search, which emits only *maximal* cliques — that call returns 0 sets for 91% of two-plant and 100% of three-plant beds, so the panel and prompt use `find_sets_for_bed()` instead, which ranks by bed coverage and names the conflicting pair; (c) a component that did not check something must not report a result that reads as a successful check (`spacing_ok=None`, `overall="unknown_bed"`, conflicts named rather than swallowed). **Read ADR-045 before touching this area** — it records all three, plus why `CompanionRelationship.source` must stay a declared dataclass field. **Two more traps this package paid for, both invisible to a green suite:** (d) the dialog's three coverage strings paired Qt's positional `%1` with Python's `.format()`, a **silent no-op** — the user saw a literal `Already in bed: %1`, and because the `%1` literal matched no `.ts` key the German dialog was half-translated. `test_german_ts_has_no_unfinished` is **structurally blind** to this: it only inspects messages already in the table, and a `tr()` literal that is never extracted is by definition not in it. The invariant is the **pairing**, not the placeholder — `%1` is *correct* where it is paired with `.replace()`. `tests/unit/test_dialog_i18n_literals.py` now pins both directions by AST-extracting each `tr()` literal and its interpolation method; (e) the new `scripts/check_no_secrets.py` matches the bearer scheme with `re.IGNORECASE` because the server does (`raw[:7].lower() == "bearer "`) — **measured 64/64 casings**, which took two corrections, because a `\b[Bb]earer\b` covered only 2 of 64 while its own docstring claimed case-insensitivity, and then a vestigial `"Bearer eyJ"` allow-marker silently exempted the *canonical* JWT spelling (markers are checked before the rules). An allow-marker that saves no tracked line is a hole, not a safety net. — see §11.4.
- **Package G (#311, #317, #318) shipped in v1.28.1 via PR #368** (owner manual test passed). #311 adds `license` + `attribution` to all bundled data files, a "Data Sources & Licenses" section in the About dialog, and a licence line in Plant Details — closing the CC BY-SA compliance gap. #317 adds a profile header to Plant Database (thumbnail, description, external links to Wikipedia/PFAF/POWO) with off-thread thumbnail fetching and disk caching. #318 adds `PermapeopleClient.get_companions()` with pagination, a local companion cache, and three-tier companion service support (bundled → custom → provider). New settings: `plants/download_images` and `plants/fetch_companion_data`.
- **#364 (HOUSE roof-ridge drift), #363 (dead issue-template links) and #372 (roof tiles lapped toward ridge) shipped in v1.28.3 via PR #371.** Canonical recompute in local polygon frame, re-derived by every state writer. See ADR-046 and §11.4.
- **US-D3.2 (#331) shipped in v1.28.4, PR #374.** Reads `get_succession_plan` / `find_succession_gaps` / `suggest_succession`, gated write `set_succession_plan`, `plan-succession` prompt. First agent write into `ProjectData`, not the scene: no geometry or badge; the badge refresh rides the existing `succession_plans_changed` signal. Refuses a TRELLIS (`is_bed_type`). Traps: **four** season segments, whose gap windows must stay **disjoint** or filling them is refused; the no-location fallback was *extracted* from the succession dialog; `check_plant_placement` cannot do within-plan rotation; `species_key` is a **function** over a dict, and a bundled plant's key is its lowercased scientific name. See ADR-034/036, §8.19, §11.4.
- **US-D3.3/D3.4 (#332/#333) shipped in v1.29.1 via PR #382**, completing Package D and closing #237. Owner approved release after plan/PR review and agent-driven live QA; the preexisting German amendment-task naming gap is tracked in #408. Nine tools and two prompts; task-status writes deliberately refuse because they are not undoable. Read ADR-034/036, §8.19 and §11.4.3–11.4.4: soil envelopes, full-year task generation, global-history staleness, secondary ratings and display-language contracts are pinned at the real MCP boundary.
- **The manual-pass follow-up package (#373, #377, #378, #380) shipped as v1.29.0.** Four defects found by dogfooding, each invisible to a green suite for a *structural* reason (§11.4.2). #377: shape-tool previews kept Qt's default `z=0` while real items get a derived z inside `(0, 100)`, so a preview drew behind any bed it overlapped; fixed by `core/tools/preview_z.py` (band 999–1002, below the minimap's 10000 cutoff); the issue's own module list was wrong (it omitted `construction_tool.py`), so a drift guard re-derives the set from source. #378: the Crop Rotation panel shows a bed's succession plan as a display-only **"Planned This Season"** section; `CropRotationService` is untouched — feeding the plan into `get_recommendation` would change the 3-year cooldown for every caller (the rejected option). #373: shutdown took ~10 s **only with an MCP client holding the SSE stream open** (0.19 s without); uvicorn's graceful shutdown waits for that connection and `force_exit` alone does **not** fix it (measured) — `stop()` now cancels the loop's tasks and stops the loop (10.03 s → 0.58 s). #380: agent writes are now canvas-clamped; the rule lives once in Qt-free `core/canvas_bounds.py`, called by both the GUI drag paths and the agent paths, with `ObjectRef.outside_canvas` + a `get_diagnostics` kind for objects already saved off-plan (a deliberate reversal of the "stage just off-plan" rationale; vertex writes are flag-only). See ADR-036 addenda, FR-AGENT-26, §8.19, §8.25.6, §11.4.2.
- **Task-date correctness + audit-P1 cluster shipped 2026-10-07 as v1.29.5 (PR #419): #414 + #415 + #395 + #396 + #398; #416 partially (#418 carries the rest).** The Tasks tab, dashboard and Gantt each anchored their frost-relative windows on the **current year's** last spring frost while the agent anchored on every year that could reach the date — swept by the committed `scripts/measure_task_window_sweep.py` (64 species x 6 frost dates x every 10th day of 2026, 222 cases): **1,849 (task, frost date, day) cases the GUI missed; 0 after, with 0 surplus tasks**. A 20 September frost put a tomato harvest at 29 Nov 2026 – 7 Feb 2027, so on 1 January 2027 a tomato-only plan read *"No tasks — you're all caught up."* Load-bearing rules: `generate_actionable_for_surface` is the one **reminder** path (Tasks tab + dashboard) and re-applies the urgency filter at the edge; the **chart** deliberately uses the unfiltered `generate_for_date_window`, because a calendar is not a reminder list. Both pass `actionable_only=False` inward — that flag is inherited *per anchor year*, so the GUI's `True` filters anchors out before the outer filter runs (it produced an empty Tasks tab and a blank Gantt here). That helper must also keep **undated** tasks (`classify_urgency` dereferences both dates) and never urgency-filter **manual** ones (their own generator's documented contract). The Gantt now consumes generated windows instead of re-deriving them (a second "offset to date" implementation — the callers only *call* `generate_calendar_tasks`, so the old count was high). **#415**: the propagation editor forced each displayed date into the current year, so a step crossing New Year was saved **inverted**; it now shows real dates, an inverted pair is refused on write and ignored on read (the stored value stays), commits happen once per gesture, and the five untranslated detail labels are localised. **#396**: the Agent API's only browser barrier was an mcp SDK default (a 1.22.0 wheel served a `Host: evil.example` initialize with **HTTP 200**); `build_server` now passes explicit `TransportSecuritySettings` with exact host:port entries and no wildcard, floor `mcp>=1.23`. **#416**: shipped half only — the `harvest_start` docstring now says what every reader always did, `KNOWN_DIVERGENT_SPECIES` pins the divergence, and the row conversion is **#418**; **garlic's harvest window lands ~3 months LATE (October, not July) under both readings**. New `core/frost_dates.py` (one parser, `02-29` → 1 March in a non-leap year, `NON_LEAP_SUBSTITUTE_MONTH_DAY`), **ADR-049** + an **ADR-029 addendum**. **#395** added 13 array-dialog tests; three first-draft assertions were wrong about the real geometry and are now pinned — `count` includes the original, +90° runs *down* the screen, circular copies lie on a circle one radius *behind* the source. Untouched: **#399**, **#401**/**#402** (baselines must measure this settled tree), **#405**, **#409**, **#406**.
- **Repo audit 2026-10 (epic #392):** snapshot `docs/11-risks-and-technical-debt/audit-2026-10.md`. §11.3 is now the living debt register with status and issue columns (ADR-047). The epic tracks 15 issues for the 2 P0 and 15 P1 findings, plus the P2/P3 checklist; work its two P0 issues before D3 and Packages F/G. Re-run the baseline with `scripts/audit_metrics.py`.
- The full shipped-story history belongs in `docs/roadmap.md`, ADRs, functional requirements, and the risk log; do not duplicate it here.
- Phase 14 remains complete; load `ogp-3d-sunshade-campaign` before touching 3D, sun/shade, growth, or solar code.

**Maintaining this file:** Update the progress summary when status changes and keep the Quick Reference current. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are a synchronized pair: if either changes, update both and run `venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_agent_context.py`.

**Version note:** CI release workflow (`release.yml`) is the sole source of truth for versions. Never create git tags manually.
