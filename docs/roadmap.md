## Development Standards

> These rules apply to every contribution — AI-assisted or human.

### Integration tests are mandatory

**Every User Story must ship with at least one end-to-end integration test.** No PR merges without it.

- Tests live in `tests/integration/test_<feature>.py`
- They exercise the full UI workflow: tool activate → mouse gesture → scene state assertion
- Shared fixtures and coordinate system notes: `tests/integration/conftest.py`
- Full policy and pattern reference: `docs/08-crosscutting-concepts/` section 8.10

### Workflow per US

1. Implement feature with type hints
2. Write unit/widget tests (`tests/unit/`, `tests/ui/`)
3. **Write integration test** (`tests/integration/`) — mandatory
4. Run `pytest tests/ -v`, `ruff check src/`, and `bandit -r src/ --severity-level high` — must all be green
5. Build exe, wait for manual user approval
6. Commit, push, PR, merge

### Translation (i18n)

Every user-visible string must be wrapped for translation. See `docs/08-crosscutting-concepts/` section 8.3.

**i18n blind-spot fixes (2026-10-04).** Three defects invisible to `test_german_ts_has_no_unfinished` are fixed together: **#393** (five duplicate `TRANSLATIONS` keys shadowed 62 strings; the five `PdfReportService` journal-notes strings never reached `de.ts`, so the German PDF printed English), **#408** (generated soil-amendment task titles stayed English; the task **id** keeps the English data name so saved done/snooze status survives a language switch), and **#410** (the agent `suggest_companions` `name` now follows the UI language, matching the Companion panel). The CI lint step is widened to `ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/`, and `tests/unit/test_i18n.py::TestTranslationRegistry` pins `TRANSLATIONS` key uniqueness with an `ast` parse. See §11.4, §8.19, and the ADR-045 addendum.

**Description**: Force two line segments to meet at exactly 90°. Like FreeCAD's "Perpendicular" — useful for paths meeting walls at right angles.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- New `PERPENDICULAR` constraint type in solver
- Workflow: click edge A → click edge B → constraint applied
- Solver rotates the free object so the angle between edges = 90°
- Dimension line visualization: small right-angle symbol at intersection
- Listed in Constraints panel as "⊾ Perpendicular"
- Undo/redo via AddConstraintCommand

### US-7.20: Equal Size Constraint

**Description**: Constrain two objects to have the same size — same radius for circles, same width or height for rectangles. Like FreeCAD's "Equal" constraint.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- New `EQUAL_RADIUS`, `EQUAL_WIDTH`, `EQUAL_HEIGHT` constraint types (or single `EQUAL` dispatching by object pair)
- Workflow: select two objects of compatible type → toolbar button creates equal constraint
- Solver resizes the free object to match the size of the pinned/reference one
- Dimension line visualization: "=" annotation near each affected object
- Listed in Constraints panel as "= Equal"
- Undo/redo via AddConstraintCommand

### US-7.21: Fix in Place (Block) Constraint

**Description**: Permanently pin an object to its current position so no solver or drag can move it. Like FreeCAD's "Block" constraint — useful for fixing the house, main fence posts, or reference objects.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- New `FIXED` constraint type (single anchor only, stores target X/Y position)
- Toolbar button or right-click → "Fix in Place"
- Object cannot be dragged or moved by solver while constraint is active
- Visual indicator: small padlock icon or crossed arrows badge on the object
- Listed in Constraints panel as "🔒 Fixed"
- Removing the constraint restores full movability
- Undo/redo via AddConstraintCommand/RemoveConstraintCommand

### US-7.22: Horizontal & Vertical Distance Constraints

**Description**: Fix the horizontal (X-axis) or vertical (Y-axis) distance between two anchors to a specific value. Distinct from H/V alignment (US-7.9): alignment makes the distance zero on one axis; this sets it to any value. Like FreeCAD's "Horizontal Dimension" and "Vertical Dimension".

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- New `HORIZONTAL_DISTANCE` and `VERTICAL_DISTANCE` constraint types in solver
- Workflow: click anchor A → click anchor B → dialog for exact distance (in meters)
- Solver maintains only the X (or Y) component of the vector, leaving the other axis free
- Dimension line visualization: horizontal (or vertical) double-arrow with value
- Dialog pre-fills current measured H/V distance
- Listed in Constraints panel as "↔ H-dist" / "↕ V-dist"
- Undo/redo via AddConstraintCommand

### US-7.23: FreeCAD-Style Constraint Toolbar with Full Icon Set

**Description**: Replace the current "Constraints" section in the left sidebar with a dedicated horizontal **constraint toolbar** docked at the top of the canvas area, styled exactly like FreeCAD's Sketcher constraint toolbar. All constraint tools are shown as icon buttons in a row: implemented tools have full-color SVG icons, not-yet-implemented tools appear grayed out (disabled) as a visual roadmap preview.

**Reference**: FreeCAD Sketcher workbench toolbar — see screenshot in project notes and look up FreeCAD's actual constraint tool icons at:
- https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_Workbench (constraint tool reference images)
- https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD source tree `src/Mod/Sketcher/Gui/Resources/icons/` (original SVG icon files for design inspiration — do not copy, use as reference only)

**Tools to include in the toolbar** (in order, matching FreeCAD layout):

| # | Tool | Status | Color |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Distance Constraint (K) | ✅ implemented | Full color |
| 2 | Horizontal Alignment | ✅ implemented | Full color |
| 3 | Vertical Alignment | ✅ implemented | Full color |
| 4 | Horizontal Distance | ⬜ US-7.22 | Grayed out |
| 5 | Vertical Distance | ⬜ US-7.22 | Grayed out |
| 6 | Coincident | ✅ US-7.17 | Done |
| 7 | Parallel | ⬜ US-7.18 | Grayed out |
| 8 | Perpendicular | ⬜ US-7.19 | Grayed out |
| 9 | Equal Size | ⬜ US-7.20 | Grayed out |
| 10 | Fix in Place | ✅ US-7.21 | Active |
| 11 | Angle Constraint | ✅ US-7.10 | Active |
| 12 | Symmetry Constraint | ✅ US-7.11 | Active |

**Acceptance Criteria**:

**Layout & placement:**
- New horizontal `QToolBar` docked at the top of the main window (below the existing main toolbar), labeled "Constraints"
- Toolbar is shown only when a constraint tool is active OR always visible (prefer always visible)
- Each button: 32×32px icon, no text label, tooltip showing name + shortcut
- Separator line between groups: Dimensional | Geometric | Advanced
- Remove the "Constraints" category from the left drawing tools panel sidebar (clean up)

**SVG icon design (create all 12 icons in `resources/icons/tools/`):**

Design language: flat, clean, 32×32 viewBox, 2px stroke, rounded caps. Use the FreeCAD icon set as visual reference for each symbol. Color palette for implemented tools:
- Dimensional constraints: deep blue (`#1565C0`) — distance arrows, dimension lines
- Geometric alignment: purple (`#6A1B9A`) — H/V alignment symbols
- Geometric relational: teal (`#00695C`) — parallel, perpendicular, coincident
- Equal/Fix: amber (`#E65100`) — equal sign, padlock

Icon designs per tool:
1. `constraint_distance.svg` — two arrows pointing inward ↔ with a dimension line and measurement hash marks; blue
2. `constraint_horizontal.svg` — horizontal double-headed arrow with a small `H` and an equals sign beneath; purple
3. `constraint_vertical.svg` — vertical double-headed arrow with a small `V` and an equals sign; purple
4. `constraint_h_distance.svg` — horizontal arrow with a numeric `d` label; blue (grayed version = same SVG, opacity 0.3)
5. `constraint_v_distance.svg` — vertical arrow with a numeric `d` label; blue
6. `constraint_coincident.svg` — two circles with overlapping centers and a dot; teal
7. `constraint_parallel.svg` — two parallel slanted lines with arrow pairs; teal
8. `constraint_perpendicular.svg` — two lines meeting at 90° with a small square corner marker; teal
9. `constraint_equal.svg` — `=` sign between two line segments of matching length; amber
10. `constraint_fixed.svg` — padlock icon with small position cross; amber
11. `constraint_angle.svg` — two lines diverging with an arc and degree symbol; blue
12. `constraint_symmetric.svg` — mirrored object pair with a dashed centerline; purple

**Not-yet-implemented buttons:**
- Show all 12 buttons in the toolbar
- Buttons for tools in US-7.10–7.22 (not yet implemented): `setEnabled(False)` + `setToolTip("Coming soon: <name>")`
- Use the same SVG but render at 30% opacity (via `QIcon` with disabled mode, or a separate `_disabled` variant)

**Translation:**
- Add toolbar title and all tooltip strings to both `.ts` files
- Recompile `.qm` files

**Technical notes:**
- `QToolBar` registered with `addToolBar(Qt.ToolBarArea.TopToolBarArea, constraint_toolbar)`
- Buttons are `QToolButton` (checkable, exclusive group) — same pattern as drawing tools panel
- Connect to `ToolManager.tool_changed` to highlight active button
- On tool switch to any constraint type: activate that button in the group
- The existing `DrawingToolsPanel` constraint section (added in US-7.9) is REMOVED in this US

## Phase 8: Location, Climate & Planting Calendar (v1.7)

**Goal**: Enable location-aware planting schedules with a dashboard showing what to do today/this week/this month.

| ID | User Story | Priority | Status |
|----|------------|----------|--------|
| US-8.1 | GPS location & climate zone setup | Must | ✅ |
| US-8.2 | Frost date & hardiness zone API lookup | Must | ✅ |
| US-8.3 | Auto-update notification & one-click installer download | Should | ✅ |
| US-8.4 | Plant calendar data model | Must | ✅ |
| US-8.5 | Planting calendar view (tab) | Must | ✅ |
| US-8.6 | Dashboard / today view | Must | ✅ |
| US-8.7 | Tab-based main window architecture | Must | ✅ |

### US-8.1: GPS Location & Climate Zone Setup

**Description**: User can set their garden's GPS coordinates to determine the local climate zone and frost dates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Canvas context menu or project settings dialog has "Set Location" option
- GPS coordinate input with latitude/longitude (decimal degrees)
- Coordinates validated (lat: -90 to 90, lon: -180 to 180)
- Tolerance for varying precision (2-6 decimal places)
- Location persisted in the project file (`.ogp`)
- Location indicator shown on canvas or status bar
- Works without GPS — user can also manually enter frost dates as fallback

**Technical Notes**:
- Add `location` dict to `ProjectData`: `{"latitude": float, "longitude": float, "elevation_m": float | None}`
- Add `frost_dates` dict: `{"last_spring_frost": "MM-DD", "first_fall_frost": "MM-DD", "hardiness_zone": "7b"}`
- Store in `.ogp` under new top-level key `"location"`
- New dialog: `ui/dialogs/location_dialog.py`
- Bump `FILE_VERSION` to `"1.2"`

### US-8.2: Frost Date & Hardiness Zone API Lookup

**Description**: Given GPS coordinates, the system automatically looks up local frost dates and hardiness zone via online APIs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- After entering GPS coordinates, frost dates are automatically fetched
- USDA zones supported (North America) via Frostline API or similar
- European zones supported via Plantmaps or DWD data
- API results populate the frost date fields automatically
- User can override auto-detected values manually
- Offline fallback: if API unavailable, user enters frost dates manually
- Loading indicator during API call

**Technical Notes**:
- New service: `services/climate_service.py`
- `ClimateService` class with `lookup_frost_dates(lat, lon) -> FrostData`
- API chain pattern similar to `PlantAPIManager`: try multiple sources
- Cache results in `get_app_data_dir()` to avoid repeated lookups
- Consider bundling a coarse hardiness zone GeoJSON for offline fallback

### US-8.3: Auto-Update Notification & One-Click Installer Download

**Description**: At application startup, silently check GitHub Releases for a newer version of the installer (Windows `.exe`). If a newer version is available, display a non-blocking notification banner (or dialog) that informs the user, shows the release notes, and offers a one-click "Download & Install" option. After download, launch the new installer and exit the running app; the NSIS installer supports `/S` silent-ish mode but will prompt for the typical "overwrite existing installation" flow. Only applies to the packaged Windows executable — development environments skip the check.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Check runs in a background thread at startup — never blocks the main window
- Compares current version (from `__version__` / git tag embedded at build time) against the latest GitHub Release tag via the GitHub Releases API (`https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest`)
- If current ≥ latest: do nothing silently
- If current < latest: show a dismissible notification bar (or `QMessageBox.information`) with:
  - "A new version (vX.Y.Z) is available"
  - Brief release notes (first 300 chars of the release body)
  - "Download & Install" button (downloads `.exe` asset to a temp dir, then launches it, then calls `QApplication.quit()`)
  - "Remind me later" / "Skip this version" button
- User preference "Skip version X.Y.Z" is persisted in QSettings
- Gracefully handles network errors (timeout, no internet) — silently skips the check
- Only active when running from the installed `.exe` (detect via `sys.frozen` or a build-time flag)
- Uses only stdlib + `urllib` for the HTTP check (no extra deps)
- Unit-testable: version comparison logic and API response parsing are pure functions

**Technical Notes**:
- Version embedding: `build_installer.py` writes `_version.py` into the bundled app at build time
- GitHub Releases API: `GET https://api.github.com/repos/cofade/open-garden-planner/releases/latest` → `{"tag_name": "v1.7.x", "body": "...", "assets": [{"name": "OpenGardenPlanner-vX.Y.Z-Setup.exe", "browser_download_url": "..."}]}`
- New file: `src/open_garden_planner/services/update_checker.py`
- Call site: `GardenPlannerApp.__init__` (after window shown), on a `QThread`
- NSIS installer supports running while the old app is closed: download → launch installer → `QApplication.quit()`

---

### US-8.4: Plant Calendar Data Model

**Description**: Extend the plant data model with sowing, transplanting, and harvest timing information.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `PlantSpeciesData` extended with planting calendar fields
- Fields: indoor sow window, direct sow window, transplant window, harvest window (all relative to last frost date)
- Days to germination, days to maturity
- Frost tolerance classification (frost-hardy, half-hardy, tender)
- Minimum germination temperature
- Seed depth (cm)
- Local hybrid database with curated data for common vegetables/herbs (50+ species)
- API fallback for extended data from Trefle/Perenual/Permapeople

**Technical Notes**:
- Extend `PlantSpeciesData` in `models/plant_data.py`:
  ```python
  # Planting calendar (weeks relative to last frost date, negative = before)
  indoor_sow_start: int | None = None   # e.g., -8 = 8 weeks before last frost
  indoor_sow_end: int | None = None
  direct_sow_start: int | None = None
  direct_sow_end: int | None = None
  transplant_start: int | None = None
  transplant_end: int | None = None
  harvest_start: int | None = None       # weeks after planting
  harvest_end: int | None = None
  days_to_germination_min: int | None = None
  days_to_germination_max: int | None = None
  days_to_maturity_min: int | None = None
  days_to_maturity_max: int | None = None
  frost_tolerance: str | None = None     # "hardy" | "half-hardy" | "tender"
  min_germination_temp_c: float | None = None
  seed_depth_cm: float | None = None
  ```
- New local database: `resources/data/planting_calendar.json` — curated data for 50+ common vegetables/herbs *(superseded in issue #170 — now `resources/data/plant_species.json`, see ADR-014)*
- Merge logic: local DB has priority, API data fills gaps

### US-8.5: Planting Calendar View

**Description**: A dedicated tab showing a month-by-month calendar of all planting activities based on the garden plan and frost dates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- New "Planting Calendar" tab in main window
- 12-month overview (scrollable) showing for each plant in the garden plan:
  - Indoor sowing window (color-coded bar)
  - Direct sowing window
  - Transplanting window
  - Expected harvest window
- Current date highlighted with a "today" marker
- Click on a plant row to see details (germination temp, seed depth, etc.)
- Calendar adjusts automatically when frost dates change
- Empty state when no plants are placed or no location is set

**Technical Notes**:
- New widget: `ui/views/planting_calendar_view.py`
- Custom `QWidget` with a grid-based Gantt chart layout
- Rows = plants from canvas, columns = weeks/months
- Color coding: blue = indoor sow, green = direct sow, orange = transplant, red = harvest
- Derives data from placed plants on canvas + `PlantSpeciesData` calendar fields + project frost dates
- Signal connection: refresh when canvas objects change or frost dates updated

### US-8.6: Dashboard / Today View

**Description**: A dashboard section at the top of the Planting Calendar tab showing actionable tasks for today and this week.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Today" panel at top of Planting Calendar tab
- Shows tasks grouped by urgency: "Overdue", "Today", "This Week", "Coming Up"
- Task types: "Start indoor sowing of X", "Transplant X outdoors", "Direct sow X", "Harvest X"
- Tasks derived automatically from placed plants + calendar data + current date
- Visual indicators for overdue tasks (red), today (yellow), upcoming (green)
- Clicking a task highlights the plant on the canvas (switches to Garden Plan tab)

**Technical Notes**:
- Integrated into `PlanningCalendarView` as a top section
- Uses `QDate.currentDate()` for "today"
- Task generation: compare current date against each plant's calculated windows
- Store task completion state per season in project file (so user can mark "done")

### US-8.7: Tab-Based Main Window Architecture

**Description**: Refactor the main window to support multiple tabs (Garden Plan, Planting Calendar, Seed Inventory).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Tab bar above the canvas area with at least "Garden Plan" tab
- Switching tabs preserves state (no data loss)
- Sidebar panels only visible on Garden Plan tab
- Tab icons for visual distinction
- Keyboard shortcut to switch tabs (Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, Ctrl+3)
- Existing functionality unchanged — Garden Plan tab works exactly as before

**Technical Notes**:
- This is a prerequisite for US-8.5 and US-9.4 — implement first
- Modify `application.py` -> `_setup_central_widget()`
- Wrap current `QSplitter` in a `QTabWidget`
- Tab 0: existing splitter (canvas + sidebar)
- Tabs 1+: new views added by subsequent phases
- Consider `QStackedWidget` if tab bar styling needs customization

  ```
- Viability rules: `resources/data/seed_viability.json` — maps species/family to shelf life in years
- Storage: new top-level key `"seed_inventory"` in `.ogp` project file
- Also store a global seed inventory in `get_app_data_dir()/seed_inventory.json` (not project-specific)

### US-9.2: Seed Viability Database

**Description**: A curated database mapping plant species/families to seed shelf life, enabling automatic viability calculation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Bundled database with viability data for 80+ common species
- Data includes: species/family, typical shelf life (years), viability curve (good/reduced/expired thresholds)
- Auto-lookup when creating a seed packet from a known species
- User can override viability for individual packets
- Source references from established seed viability charts

**Technical Notes**:
- JSON file: `resources/data/seed_viability.json`

      "Brassicaceae": {"shelf_life_years": 5, "reduced_after_years": 4}
    }
  }
  ```
- Lookup order: exact species match -> family match -> default (3 years)

### US-9.3: Seed Inventory Management Panel

**Description**: A dedicated panel/dialog for adding, editing, and browsing seed packets.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Accessible from Plants menu -> "Manage Seed Inventory"
- Table/card view showing all seed packets with key info at a glance
- Color-coded viability status: green (good), yellow (reduced), red (expired)
- Add new seed packet (with plant species autocomplete from plant database)
- Edit existing seed packet
- Delete seed packet (with confirmation)
- Sort by: name, year, viability, quantity
- Filter by: status (good/reduced/expired), plant family, year
- Search bar for quick finding
- "Needs reorder" indicator when quantity is low (user-defined threshold)

**Technical Notes**:
- New dialog: `ui/dialogs/seed_inventory_dialog.py`
- `QTableView` with custom `QAbstractTableModel` for the seed list
- Or `QListWidget` with custom `QWidget` items for card-style layout
- Reuse plant search/autocomplete from existing `PlantSearchPanel`

- Same functionality as the dialog but always accessible
- Quick-add button for new seed packets
- Summary statistics at top: total packets, expired count, needs reorder count
- Batch operations: mark multiple as used, delete multiple

**Technical Notes**:
- New widget: `ui/views/seed_inventory_view.py`
- Shares model/logic with seed inventory dialog (extract into shared service)
- New service: `services/seed_inventory_service.py` — manages CRUD, persistence, viability calculations

### US-9.5: Propagation Planning (Pre-Cultivation)

**Description**: Plan the full indoor propagation cycle: sowing -> germination -> pricking out -> hardening off -> transplanting.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- For each seed packet or plant in the garden plan, show a propagation timeline:
  1. **Indoor sowing** — start date, required temperature, seed depth
  2. **Germination** — expected duration, check dates
  3. **Pricking out (Pikieren)** — when seedlings have first true leaves
  4. **Hardening off (Abhärten)** — gradual outdoor exposure period (typically 7-14 days)
  5. **Transplanting** — final outdoor planting date (after last frost)
- Each step has a calculated date based on species data + frost dates
- Steps shown as a timeline/Gantt chart in the Planting Calendar
- User can adjust individual dates
- Propagation steps generate tasks in the Dashboard

**Technical Notes**:
- Extend `PlanningCalendarView` with propagation sub-steps
- New model: `models/propagation.py` — `PropagationPlan` with steps
- Default step durations in `plant_species.json` (formerly `planting_calendar.json`, see ADR-014):
  ```json
  {
    "tomato": {
      "indoor_sow_weeks_before_frost": 8,
      "germination_days": [7, 14],
      "prick_out_after_days": 21,
      "harden_off_days": 10,
      "transplant_after_last_frost_days": 14
    }
  }
  ```
- Link propagation plans to seed packets (optional manual linking)

### US-9.6: Seed-to-Plant Manual Linking

**Description**: User can optionally link a seed packet to a placed plant on the canvas.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- In the Properties panel (when a plant is selected), option to "Link Seed Packet"
- Dropdown/search showing matching seed packets from inventory
- Linked seed packet info shown in Properties panel
- Unlinking is always possible
- Linking does NOT auto-decrement seed quantity (manual quantity management only)
- Linked seeds appear in the Planting Calendar with their propagation timeline

**Technical Notes**:
- Store `seed_packet_id` in `PlantInstance.custom_fields`
- Extend `PropertiesPanel` with seed packet link UI
- Bidirectional: seed inventory view shows which plants a packet is linked to

## Phase 10: Companion Planting & Crop Rotation (v1.8.6 – v1.8.12)

**Goal**: Help gardeners optimize plant placement with companion planting recommendations and multi-year crop rotation tracking.

| ID | User Story | Priority | Status |
|----|------------|----------|--------|
| US-10.1 | Companion planting database | Must | ✅ v1.8.6 |
| US-10.2 | Companion planting visual warnings | Must | ✅ v1.8.7 |

| US-10.6 | Crop rotation recommendations | Should | ✅ v1.8.11 |
| US-10.7 | Season management & plan duplication | Could | ✅ v1.8.12 |

### US-10.1: Companion Planting Database

**Description**: A curated database of plant compatibility (good neighbors, bad neighbors).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Bundled database with companion planting data for 60+ common vegetables/herbs/flowers
- Relationship types: "beneficial" (good neighbor), "antagonistic" (bad neighbor), "neutral"
- Bidirectional relationships (if A helps B, that's recorded for both)
- Reasons/notes for each relationship (e.g., "repels aphids", "competes for nutrients")
- Data sourced from established gardening references
- User can add custom companion planting rules

**Technical Notes**:
- JSON file: `resources/data/companion_planting.json`
  ```json
  {
    "relationships": [
      {
        "plant_a": "tomato",
        "plant_b": "basil",
        "type": "beneficial",
        "reason": "Basil repels aphids and improves tomato flavor"
      },
      {
        "plant_a": "tomato",
        "plant_b": "fennel",
        "type": "antagonistic",
        "reason": "Fennel inhibits tomato growth"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- New service: `services/companion_planting_service.py`
- Lookup by species name, common name, or family

### US-10.2: Companion Planting Visual Warnings

**Description**: When placing or moving a plant on the canvas, visually indicate compatibility with neighboring plants.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When a plant is selected or being placed, nearby plants are highlighted:
  - Green glow/border: beneficial companion
  - Red glow/border: antagonistic plant
  - No highlight: neutral
- "Nearby" defined by a configurable radius (default: 2m)
- Warnings shown in real-time during drag operations
- Can be toggled on/off in View menu
- Works with both existing placed plants and new plant placement

**Technical Notes**:
- Extend `GardenItem` / plant items with a `set_companion_highlight(type)` method
- Use `QGraphicsDropShadowEffect` or colored border overlay
- Proximity check: iterate nearby items within radius, check companion DB
- Trigger on: item selection, item move, new item placement
- Performance: spatial index or simple distance check (gardens are small)

### US-10.3: Companion Planting Recommendation Panel

**Description**: A sidebar panel showing companion planting recommendations for the selected plant.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When a plant is selected, a panel shows:
  - "Good Companions" list with reasons
  - "Bad Companions" list with reasons
  - Which companions are already nearby in the plan
- Clicking a companion in the list highlights it on the canvas (if placed)
- Panel integrated into existing Plant Details panel or as new collapsible panel

**Technical Notes**:
- Extend `PlantDatabasePanel` or create new `CompanionPanel`
- Query `CompanionPlantingService` with selected plant's species
- Cross-reference with plants currently on canvas

### US-10.4: Whole-Plan Compatibility Check

**Description**: Analyze the entire garden plan for companion planting issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Menu action: Plants -> "Check Companion Planting"
- Scans all plant pairs within proximity radius
- Report dialog showing:
  - Number of beneficial pairings
  - Number of antagonistic pairings (warnings)
  - List of each conflict with plant names, distance, and reason
- Option to highlight all conflicts on the canvas simultaneously
- "Score" or rating for overall plan compatibility

**Technical Notes**:
- New dialog: `ui/dialogs/companion_check_dialog.py`
- Algorithm: for each plant pair within radius, check companion DB
- O(n^2) but fine for garden-scale (typically <100 plants)

### US-10.5: Crop Rotation Data Model

**Description**: Track what was planted where across multiple years/seasons for crop rotation planning.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Each bed/area can have a planting history: year -> list of plants
- History persisted in project file
- Plant family classification for rotation rules (Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, etc.)
- Nutrient demand classification: heavy feeder, medium feeder, light feeder, nitrogen fixer (green manure)
- Data for 60+ common species included in the local database

**Technical Notes**:
- Extend `PlantSpeciesData`:
  ```python
  nutrient_demand: str | None = None   # "heavy" | "medium" | "light" | "fixer"
  # family field already exists
  ```
- New model in `models/crop_rotation.py`:
  ```python
  @dataclass
  class PlantingRecord:
      year: int
      season: str           # "spring" | "summer" | "fall" | "winter"
      species_name: str
      family: str
      nutrient_demand: str
      area_id: str          # links to a garden item (bed/area)

  @dataclass
  class CropRotationHistory:
      records: list[PlantingRecord]
  ```
- Store as `"crop_rotation"` key in `.ogp` file
- Nutrient demand data in `resources/data/plant_species.json` (formerly `planting_calendar.json`, see ADR-014)

### US-10.6: Crop Rotation Recommendations

**Description**: Based on planting history, recommend what to plant in each bed this year.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- For each bed with history, show rotation recommendation:
  - Avoid: same family as last 2-3 years
  - Prefer: follow heavy feeders with medium/light feeders
  - Ideal rotation: Heavy -> Medium -> Light -> Green Manure -> Heavy
- Visual indicator on beds: green (good rotation), yellow (suboptimal), red (violation)
- Recommendation panel showing suggested plant families for each bed
- Warning when placing a plant that violates rotation rules

**Technical Notes**:
- New service: `services/crop_rotation_service.py`
- Rule engine: check last N years of history for family/demand conflicts
- Integrate with companion planting visual system (similar highlight approach)

### US-10.7: Season Management & Plan Duplication

**Description**: Manage multiple seasons/years and duplicate plans for a new season.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "New Season" action: duplicate current plan as starting point for next year
- Previous season's plant placements become the rotation history for the new season
- Season selector in the UI to switch between years
- Each season is a separate state of the canvas (different plants, same beds/structures)
- Beds/paths/structures carry over, plants are cleared or kept as user chooses
- Compare view: overlay previous season's plants as ghosted/faded

**Technical Notes**:
- Major feature — likely the most complex US in this phase
- Recommend separate `.ogp` files linked via `"linked_seasons"` metadata field
- Season management dialog: `ui/dialogs/season_manager_dialog.py`

### Block 1: Bed Interior Design (Top Priority)

### US-11.1: Plant-Bed Parent-Child Relationship

**Description**: Plants placed inside a bed become children of that bed — they move with it, appear in its plant list, and respect its boundaries.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When a plant is placed inside a bed's boundary, it's automatically parented to that bed
- Moving a bed moves all its child plants
- Deleting a bed prompts: keep or delete child plants
- Plants can be detached from a bed (drag outside or explicit unlink)
- Bed properties panel shows a list of contained plants with counts
- Copy/paste a bed includes its child plants
- Undo/redo preserves parent-child relationships
- Serialization saves/loads plant-bed associations

**Technical Notes**:
- Extend `GardenItemMixin` with `_parent_bed_id: UUID | None` and `_child_item_ids: list[UUID]`
- Use manual tracking (not Qt's `setParentItem()`) to avoid transform issues
- Modify `commands.py` MoveCommand to propagate movement to children
- Files to modify: `garden_item.py`, `commands.py`, `project.py` (serialization), `properties_panel.py`

---

### US-11.2: Plant Spacing Circles & Overlap Warnings

**Description**: When placing a plant in a bed, show its recommended spacing as a translucent circle. Warn if plants overlap or are too close. Spacing defaults from the plant database but is user-configurable per placement.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Each plant shows a faint spacing circle (radius = recommended spacing / 2) when selected or in bed-edit mode
- Spacing value defaults from plant database, user can override in properties panel
- Red highlight / warning icon when spacing circles overlap (plants too close)
- Green highlight when spacing is ideal
- Toggle spacing circles visibility on/off (toolbar button or View menu)
- Spacing data serialized with the plant item
- Works for all plant types: trees, shrubs, perennials, vegetables

**Technical Notes**:
- Add `_spacing_radius: float` to plant items (CircleItem when used as plant)
- Render spacing circle as `QGraphicsEllipseItem` child with low-opacity fill
- Overlap detection: iterate sibling plants in same bed, check distance < sum of spacing radii
- Files: `circle_item.py` (plant rendering), `plant_data.py` (spacing field), `properties_panel.py`

---

### US-11.3: Square-Foot Grid Overlay

**Description**: Any bed can display a customizable interior grid overlay for square-foot gardening or other spacing systems.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Grid spacing configurable: 30cm (square-foot), 15cm, 40cm, or custom value
- Grid clips to the bed shape (works with polygons, rectangles, any shape)
- Grid lines are subtle (thin, semi-transparent) and don't appear in exports unless opted in
- Grid cell count shown in bed properties
- Grid offset/rotation follows the bed's rotation
- Grid settings serialized per-bed

**Technical Notes**:
- Add grid rendering to bed items (PolygonItem, RectangleItem when used as GARDEN_BED)
- Use `QPainter.setClipPath(bed_shape)` to clip grid to bed boundary
- Store `_grid_enabled: bool`, `_grid_spacing: float` in GardenItemMixin or bed-specific mixin

- Render as child `QGraphicsSimpleTextItem` positioned at centroid
- Files: `garden_item.py`, `rectangle_item.py`, `polygon_item.py`, `circle_item.py`

---

### US-11.10: Callout / Leader Line Annotations

**Description**: Annotation callouts with leader lines (arrows pointing from a text box to a specific feature on the plan).

**Acceptance Criteria**:

## Outlook: Additional 2D Features (Candidates for Phase 11 Expansion)

Features identified through competitive analysis of 15+ CAD tools (LibreCAD, QCAD, DraftSight, Inkscape, Affinity Designer, Figma) and 13+ garden planners (GrowVeg, Almanac, Artifact Interactive, iScape, VegPlotter, etc.). These ranked highly but didn't make the initial Phase 11 cut. Revisit after completing Phase 11 core blocks.

### Drawing Tools

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Bezier / Spline curves** | High | #1 missing geometry primitive per CAD research. Gardens are organic — curved beds, winding paths, pond outlines need smooth curves. Requires new BezierItem + BezierTool + handle-edit mode. |
| **Arc tool (3-point)** | High | FR-DRAW-06 already listed. Click start, through-point, end to define circular arc. New ArcItem. Natural complement to bezier for precise curved segments. |
| **Fillet & Chamfer** | High | Round off (fillet) or bevel (chamfer) sharp corners on paths, patios, beds. Real gardens never have perfectly sharp 90° corners. Every major CAD tool has this. |
| **Mirror tool** | Medium | Mirror objects across a user-defined axis. Essential for symmetric garden designs. Easy to implement — transform + copy. |
| **Break / Divide / Split** | Low | Split an entity at a click point or divide into N equal segments. Useful for splitting long paths or bed edges. |
| **Stretch tool** | Low | Move vertices inside a selection window while fixing those outside. Power-user CAD feature. |

### Precision Input & Snapping

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Relative coordinate input (@dx,dy)** | High | Type `@500,0` to draw 500cm right from last point. Currently users must calculate absolute coordinates. Fundamental CAD precision input. |
| **Polar coordinate input (dist<angle)** | Medium | Specify next point as `@300<45` (300cm at 45°). Useful for angled paths and non-orthogonal layouts. Pairs with relative input. |
| **Additional snap modes** | High | Missing: midpoint (snap to edge center), intersection (where two objects cross), nearest (closest point on edge), perpendicular, tangent. Midpoint and intersection are most impactful. |
| **Dynamic input (on-cursor fields)** | Medium | Floating distance/angle fields near cursor while drawing, Tab to switch. Eliminates looking at status bar. Professional feel. |
| **Object snap tracking** | Low | Temporary dynamic alignment guides from snap points. AutoCAD power feature. |

### Layout & Output

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Paper space / print layout** | High | Separate model space (draw 1:1) from paper space (arrange views for printing). Multiple viewports at different scales, title blocks, legends on one sheet. Transforms output from screenshot-quality to professional deliverable. Partially covered by US-11.19 (multi-page PDF) but this is the full CAD approach. |
| **Scale bar for prints** | Medium | Auto-generated scale bar adjusting to print scale. Essential for field-usable printed plans. Simple to implement, high value. Could be added to US-11.19. |
| **Dimension styles** | Low | Named styles for dimension appearance (arrowhead type, text height, decimal precision). Polish feature. |

### Selection & Interaction

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Crossing/window selection modes** | Medium | Right-to-left drag = crossing (select touched), left-to-right = window (select enclosed). Professional CAD convention. |
| **Lasso selection** | Low | Freehand selection outline for irregularly grouped objects in dense layouts. |
| **Interactive scale tool** | Low | Scale by precise factor with selectable base point. Currently possible via properties panel but no interactive tool. |

### Visual & Domain-Specific

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Paving pattern fills** | Medium | Parametric paving layouts (herringbone, running bond, basket weave) for patios/driveways. Domain-specific visual appeal. |
| **Associative hatch patterns** | Low | Hatch auto-updates when boundary shape changes. Currently fill patterns are static. |
| **Text along path** | Low | Flow text along curved edges for labeling paths, borders. Visual polish. |
| **PDF vector import** | Low | Import PDF and convert to editable vector geometry. Nice-to-have but background image import covers basic need. |

### Smart Features (from Garden Planner Competitors)

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Harvest tracking / yield log** | Medium | Log harvest amounts per crop, compare year-over-year. GrowVeg, BioGarden365, VegPlotter have this. Key for improving gardens season to season. Natural extension of garden journal (US-11.23). |
| **Task management / reminders** | Medium | Auto-generate tasks from planting calendar ("Start tomato seeds indoors this week"). GrowVeg does biweekly email alerts from 5,000+ weather stations. High user satisfaction. |
| **Vertical gardening support** | Medium | Growing trend, no competitor handles well. Support for vertical structures, trellises, wall planters. |
| **Container / balcony gardening** | Medium | Frequently requested, poorly served by competitors. Container objects with soil volume, drainage, plant capacity. |
| **Microclimate modeling** | Low | Zero competitors have this. Map microclimates within the garden (wind corridors, heat sinks, frost pockets). Blue ocean but complex. |
| **Soil analysis integration** | Low | Connect soil test results to per-bed recommendations. Nobody does this. |
| **Water usage calculation** | Low | Calculate water needs per zone based on plants, area, climate. Sustainability angle. |
| **Permaculture design tools** | Low | Guilds, zones (0–5), sectors. Only SAGE partially covers this. Large underserved niche community. |
| **Parametric blocks / smart symbols** | Medium | Reusable symbols with configurable parameters (e.g., "raised bed" with length/width/rows). Elevates from drawing tool to design tool. |

### Competitive Benchmarks

- **GrowVeg** (market leader): 21,657 plant varieties, 5,000+ weather stations, biweekly personalized reminders, auto plant count, garden journal with harvest tracking, 441 how-to videos. Weakness: no CAD precision, no seed inventory, subscription-only, web-dependent.
- **OGP's unique strengths**: CAD-precision tools (constraints, dimension lines, angle/symmetry constraints, guide lines, arrays) are unmatched. Seed inventory with viability tracking, companion planting with canvas-level visual warnings, crop rotation data model. Open-source and offline-first.
- **Blue ocean**: Sun/shade simulation (no competitor has it built-in), microclimate modeling, permaculture zones.

| US-12.5  | Multi-page PDF export                        | Should   | ✅     |
| US-12.6  | Shopping list generation                     | Could    | ✅     |
| US-12.7  | Pest & disease log                           | Could    | ✅     |
| US-12.8  | Succession planting                          | Could    | ✅     |
| US-12.9  | Garden journal (map-linked notes)            | Could    | ✅     |
| US-12.10 | Soil health tracking & amendment calculator  | Must     | ✅     |
| US-12.11 | Smart amendment composition + library toggle | Should   | ✅     |

### US-12.1: Weather Forecast Widget

**Description**: At app startup, fetch a 16-day weather forecast for the project's GPS location (set in US-8.1) from the Open-Meteo API and display it in the Dashboard section of the Planting Calendar tab.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Forecast fetched on startup in a background `QThread` — never blocks main window
- Source: Open-Meteo `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast` with params `daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,precipitation_sum,weathercode&forecast_days=16&timezone=auto`
- No API key required
- **7-day compact strip**: icon (WMO weather code mapped to emoji/SVG), min/max °C, precipitation mm, for days 1–7
- **14-day expandable table**: collapsible section below showing days 8–16 as a table (date, icon, max, min, rain)
- Offline / fetch failed: show most recent cached data with "Last updated X ago" label in muted style
- If no project GPS set: show "Set a location to enable weather forecast" empty state with link to location dialog
- Cache stored in `get_app_data_dir()/weather_cache_{lat:.4f}_{lon:.4f}.json` alongside a fetch timestamp
- Cache considered stale after 3 hours; if fresh (< 3h old) and offline, use cache silently without re-fetching
- No additional Python dependencies — use only `urllib` (stdlib)
- All UI strings wrapped in `self.tr()` / translated in both `.ts` files

**Technical Notes**:
- New service: `src/open_garden_planner/services/weather_service.py`
  - `WeatherService` with `fetch_forecast(lat, lon) -> WeatherForecast | None`
  - `WeatherForecast` dataclass: `days: list[DayForecast]`, `fetched_at: str`
  - `DayForecast`: `date: str, max_c: float, min_c: float, precipitation_mm: float, weathercode: int`
  - WMO code → icon mapping dict (0=☀, 1–3=⛅, 45–48=🌫, 51–67=🌧, 71–77=🌨, 80–82=🌦, 95+=⛈)
  - Cache logic: load/save JSON with timestamp check
- New widget: `src/open_garden_planner/ui/widgets/weather_widget.py`
  - `WeatherWidget(QWidget)` — fetches via `WeatherService`, renders strip + expandable table
  - Signals: `fetch_started`, `fetch_complete`, `fetch_failed`
  - Embedded at top of `PlanningCalendarView.dashboard_section`
- Modify: `src/open_garden_planner/ui/views/planting_calendar_view.py` — add `WeatherWidget` at top of dashboard panel
- Integration test: `tests/integration/test_weather_widget.py` — mock urllib, assert strip renders, assert cache shown with age label

### US-12.2: Frost Alert & Plant-Aware Warnings

**Description**: When the weather forecast includes nights below configurable thresholds, generate visible frost alerts in the Dashboard. Alerts are cross-referenced against frost-sensitive plants placed on the canvas to produce actionable "bring in X tonight" tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Two threshold levels, configurable in **Settings → Weather**:
  - **Orange warning**: min temp ≤ 5°C (default) — half-hardy plants at risk
  - **Red alert**: min temp ≤ 2°C (default) — tender plants at risk
- Forecast days hitting a threshold highlighted in the 7-day strip (orange/red background tint on that day's cell)
- Dashboard task list shows frost alert entries: `⚠ Frost tonight: -1°C — protect Tomato (Bed A), Basil (Pot)`
- Tasks include a "Highlight on map" button that switches to Garden Plan tab and selects affected plants
- **Plant sensitivity source** (in priority order):
  1. Per-plant override: new `frost_protection_needed: bool | None` field on plant items (None = use DB default)
  2. `PlantSpeciesData.frost_tolerance`: `"tender"` → warned at red threshold; `"half-hardy"` → warned at orange threshold; `"hardy"` → no warning
- Per-plant override exposed as a checkbox **"Needs frost protection"** in the Properties panel (plant selected)
- Frost alerts re-evaluated whenever the weather cache refreshes or the project is opened
- Settings persist in `QSettings` under `weather/frost_warning_orange_c` and `weather/frost_warning_red_c`
- All strings translated in both `.ts` files

**Technical Notes**:
- Extend `WeatherService`: add `get_frost_alerts(forecast, plants, orange_threshold, red_threshold) -> list[FrostAlert]`
  - `FrostAlert` dataclass: `date: str, min_temp: float, severity: str ("orange"|"red"), affected_plant_ids: list[str]`
- Extend `GardenItemMixin` (plant items only): add `frost_protection_needed: bool | None = None`; serialize in `project.py`
- Extend `PropertiesPanel`: add "Needs frost protection" `QCheckBox` (visible when plant selected)
- Extend `SettingsDialog`: new "Weather" section with two `QDoubleSpinBox` fields for thresholds
- Extend `PlanningCalendarView` dashboard: inject `FrostAlert` tasks into existing task list (sorted by date)
- Modify `WeatherWidget`: tint frost days in the 7-day strip
- Integration test: `tests/integration/test_frost_alerts.py` — mock forecast with frost day, assert dashboard task appears, assert plant highlight works

- New dialog: `src/open_garden_planner/ui/dialogs/dxf_import_dialog.py`
- Extend `dxf_service.py` with import functions
- Use `ezdxf.readfile()` + entity iteration

---

### US-12.5: Multi-Page PDF Export

**Description**: Generate a professional multi-page PDF report: cover page, plan overview, zoomed detail views, plant list, planting calendar, and legend.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Export PDF Report..." in File menu
- Pages: cover (project name, date, author) → full plan overview → detail views (one per bed, optional) → plant list table → planting calendar → legend

---

### Block 3: Smart Features

### US-12.6: Shopping List Generation

**Description**: Auto-generate a shopping list from the garden plan with plant quantities, seed needs, materials, and optional cost estimates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Generate Shopping List" action (menu or toolbar)
- Lists: plants (type, quantity, size), seeds (from seed inventory gaps), materials (soil volume for beds, mulch area)
- Exportable as CSV, PDF, or printable
- Optional cost column (user enters prices per item)
- Groups by category (plants, seeds, materials)

**Follow-up issues (all resolved in one PR):**
- ✅ **#176**: ADR-016 — canonical `species_key()` helper in `models/plant_data.py`; migrated all call sites.
- ✅ **#177**: Extended Materials with "Soil fill" (m³, per-bed configurable depth) and "Mulch" (m²) rows.
- ✅ **#178**: Prune orphan `shopping_list_prices` entries on project save.

---

### US-12.7: Pest & Disease Log

**Description**: Track pest sightings and disease outbreaks per bed/plant with treatment notes and photos.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Right-click bed/plant > "Log Pest/Disease"
- Entry: date, type (pest/disease), name, severity, treatment, photo attachment
- History viewable per-bed and per-plant
- Overview panel showing all active issues across the garden
- Data serialized in project file

**Implementation Notes**:
- Data model: `PestLogRecord` / `PestLogHistory` in `src/open_garden_planner/models/pest_log.py`. Severity is categorical (`low`/`medium`/`high`); type is `pest` or `disease`.
- Persistence: serialised under top-level `pest_disease_logs` key as `{target_id: PestLogHistory.to_dict()}`. Photos copied into `{project_dir}/pest_photos/` and stored as project-relative POSIX paths so the .ogp file stays portable.
- Commands: `AddPestLogCommand`, `EditPestLogCommand`, `DeletePestLogCommand` — all undoable, snapshotting prior history for clean restore.
- UI: `PestLogDialog` (Entry + History tabs) opens from the right-click menu on rectangle/circle items (beds and plants). Sidebar `PestOverviewPanel` lists every unresolved entry with double-click reactivation.
- Season carryover: only `resolved=False` records carry to the new season. Resolved entries stay in the previous season as historical record. This makes permanent issues (tree borers) persist while treated outbreaks (a one-off aphid bloom) drop off.
- Photo attachment is gated on a saved project — the button is disabled with tooltip *"Save project first to attach photos"* until `project_manager.current_file` is set.

---

### US-12.8: Succession Planting

**Description**: Plan multiple sequential plantings in the same bed within a season.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Bed timeline view showing planting slots per season segment (early spring, late spring, summer, fall)
- Assign different plants to different time slots in the same bed
- Calendar integration: succession plants appear in planting calendar at correct dates
- Visual indicator on bed showing current/next planting
- Companion planting rules apply within each succession group

---

### US-12.9: Garden Journal (Map-Linked Notes)

**Description**: Pin notes and photos to specific locations on the garden plan, creating a visual garden diary.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- New "Note" tool — click on canvas to place a pin icon
- Click pin to expand note: date, text (rich text), photo attachment
- Pin icon shows on the plan view, subtle when collapsed
- Notes filterable by date range
- Notes included in PDF report export (optional)
- Search across all notes
- Notes serialized in project file

**Technical Notes**:
- New item: `src/open_garden_planner/ui/canvas/items/note_item.py`
- New tool: `src/open_garden_planner/core/tools/note_tool.py`
- Photo storage: save photos in project directory alongside .ogp file

### US-12.10: Soil Health Tracking & Amendment Calculator

**Phase**: 12 | **Block**: Smart Features | **Priority**: Must

#### Background

User conducts periodic soil tests (pH, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) using Rapitest-style kits or professional lab
reports. OGP records results per bed, visualises soil health on the canvas, and — using the bed's known area
from the CAD model — computes precise amendment quantities in grams. No other garden app can do this because
none carry the geometric model.

**Implemented in five modular sub-stories — execute in order:**

| Sub-story  | Description                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| US-12.10a  | Data model + right-click entry dialog + .ogp storage       |
| US-12.10b  | Canvas overlay: overall health tint + parameter drilldown  |
| US-12.10c  | Amendment calculator: inline per-bed + Amendment Plan dialog|
| US-12.10d  | Plant-soil compatibility warnings: bed border + Dashboard  |
| US-12.10e  | Full history + sparkline charts + seasonal reminder badge  |

---

#### Data Model

**New file**: `src/open_garden_planner/models/soil_test.py`

```python
# NPK scale follows Rapitest kit:
#   N: 0=Depleted, 1=Deficient, 2=Adequate, 3=Sufficient, 4=Surplus
#   P: 0=Depleted, 1=Deficient, 2=Adequate, 3=Sufficient, 4=Surplus
#   K: 1=Deficient, 2=Adequate, 3=Sufficient, 4=Surplus  (no K0 in kit)
# Secondary nutrients: 0=Low, 1=Medium, 2=High

@dataclass
class SoilTestRecord:
    date: str                    # ISO 8601, e.g. "2026-04-25"
    ph: float | None = None
    n_level: int | None = None   # 0–4
    p_level: int | None = None   # 0–4
    k_level: int | None = None   # 1–4
    ca_level: int | None = None  # 0–2
    mg_level: int | None = None  # 0–2
    s_level: int | None = None   # 0–2
    notes: str = ""

@dataclass
class SoilTestHistory:
    target_id: str               # bed UUID or "global" for project-wide default
    records: list[SoilTestRecord]
```

**Storage**: `.ogp` JSON top-level key `"soil_tests"` → `{target_id: SoilTestHistory.to_dict()}`.

**Hierarchy**: effective record = bed's own latest → fallback to global latest (future: zone in between).

**Plant DB extension** (`src/open_garden_planner/models/plant_data.py`):
Add to `PlantSpeciesData` after `nutrient_demand`:
```python
n_demand: str | None = None   # "low" | "medium" | "high" | "fixer"
p_demand: str | None = None
k_demand: str | None = None
```
Backward-compat: `nutrient_demand="heavy"` → `n_demand="high"` mapped lazily in `SoilService`.

#### Amendment Config

**New file**: `src/open_garden_planner/data/amendments.json` (version `"1.0"`)

12 substances bundled at ship time; UI editor deferred. Each entry has:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable key for code references |
| `name` / `name_de` | Localised display name |
| `fixes` | List of effects: `"raises_pH"`, `"lowers_pH"`, `"adds_N"`, `"adds_P"`, `"adds_K"`, `"adds_Ca"`, `"adds_Mg"`, `"adds_S"`, `"improves_structure"` |
| `application_rate_g_m2` | Default quantity for one level correction |
| `ph_effect_per_100g_m2` | pH units changed per 100 g/m² applied |
| `{n/p/k/ca/mg}_level_effect` | NPK level steps per one application |
| `organic` | `true` / `false` |
| `release_speed` | `"fast"` / `"slow"` / `"very_slow"` |

Bundled substances: garden lime, dolomite lime, sulfur, blood meal, bone meal, wood ash, compost,
well-rotted manure, epsom salt, gypsum, greensand, rock phosphate.

#### Service Layer

**New file**: `src/open_garden_planner/services/soil_service.py`

```python
class SoilService:
    def get_history(self, target_id: str) -> SoilTestHistory: ...
    def get_effective_record(self, bed_id: str) -> SoilTestRecord | None: ...
    def add_record(self, target_id: str, record: SoilTestRecord) -> None: ...
    def calculate_amendments(self, current, target_ph, target_n, target_p, target_k,
                             bed_area_m2) -> list[AmendmentRecommendation]: ...
    def get_mismatched_plants(self, bed_id, plants) -> list[tuple[PlantItem, list[str]]]: ...
    def is_test_overdue(self, bed_id: str) -> bool: ...  # month in {3,4,9,10} AND >180 days
    def overall_health_color(self, record: SoilTestRecord) -> HealthLevel: ...

@dataclass
class AmendmentRecommendation:
    amendment_id: str
    name: str
    quantity_g: float
    rationale: str   # e.g. "Raises pH from 5.8 → 6.5"

class HealthLevel(Enum):
    GOOD = "good"    # green  (100,200,100,80)
    FAIR = "fair"    # amber  (255,200,0,80)
    POOR = "poor"    # red    (220,60,60,80)
    UNTESTED = "untested"  # grey diagonal-hatch
```

Amendment calc formulas:
- pH: `qty_g = abs(target_ph - current_ph) / substance["ph_effect_per_100g_m2"] * 100 * bed_area_m2`
- NPK: `qty_g = (target_level - current_level) * substance["application_rate_g_m2"] * bed_area_m2`

#### US-12.10a: Data Model, Entry & Storage

**Branch**: `feature/US-12.10a-soil-data-model`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Right-click bed → "Add soil test…" → `SoilTestDialog` opens
- Dialog: date picker (default today), pH field (float 0–14), N/P/K dropdowns (None + N0–N4 labels),
  Ca/Mg/S dropdowns (None + Low/Medium/High), notes textarea, Kit/Lab mode toggle
- Kit mode shows categorical labels (Depleted…Surplus); Lab mode shows numeric ppm input
- Garden menu → "Set default soil test…" opens same dialog with `target_id="global"`
- Data persists in `.ogp` `"soil_tests"` key; project marked dirty; undo/redo supported

**Key i18n strings** (add to `scripts/fill_translations.py`):
```
"Add soil test…", "Soil Test", "Soil Test — {name}", "Default Soil Test",
"pH (0–14)", "Nitrogen (N)", "Phosphorus (P)", "Potassium (K)",
"Calcium (Ca)", "Magnesium (Mg)", "Sulfur (S)", "Notes",
"Depleted", "Deficient", "Adequate", "Sufficient", "Surplus",
"Low", "Medium", "High", "Kit (categorical)", "Lab (ppm)"
```

**Integration test** `tests/integration/test_soil_test_entry.py`:
```python
def test_add_soil_test_to_bed_and_persist(app, qtbot, tmp_path):
    # draw rectangle bed → right-click → "Add soil test…"
    # fill: pH=6.2, N=1 (Deficient), P=1, K=1 → accept
    # assert project_data.soil_tests[bed_id].latest.ph == 6.2
    # save to tmp_path → reload → assert round-trip preserves all fields
```

---

#### US-12.10b: Canvas Soil Health Overlay

**Branch**: `feature/US-12.10b-soil-overlay`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- View → "Soil Health Overlay" toggle (Ctrl+Shift+S) tints beds by worst parameter
- Toolbar `QComboBox` (only visible when overlay on): Overall / pH / N / P / K
- Untested beds: grey `Qt.BrushStyle.DiagCrossPattern` fill (alpha 40)
- Overlay excluded from PDF/image exports

**Implementation**:
- `CanvasScene`: add `_soil_overlay_visible: bool = False`, `_soil_overlay_param: str = "overall"`
- Override `drawForeground(painter, rect)` → call `_paint_soil_overlay(painter)` when active
- `_paint_soil_overlay`: iterate bed items → `SoilService.get_effective_record(item_id)` → draw
  `QColor(r,g,b,80)` filled polygon over `item.mapToScene(item.boundingRect())`
- Color map: GOOD=`(100,200,100,80)`, FAIR=`(255,200,0,80)`, POOR=`(220,60,60,80)`
- Per-parameter colour: pH ideal 6.0–7.0; NPK 0/1=red, 2=amber, 3/4=green

**Integration test** `tests/integration/test_soil_overlay.py`

---

#### US-12.10c: Amendment Calculator ✅

**Branch**: implemented on `claude/check-clustering-next-steps-E4ReB` (PR #166).

**Acceptance criteria** (all met):
- `SoilTestDialog` "Amendments" section: target selectors → inline list of amendment + grams for this bed
- Garden → "Amendment Plan…" → `AmendmentPlanDialog`: all deficient beds, grouped by substance,
  totals per substance, "Add all to Shopping List" button (clipboard text — US-12.6 deferred)
- Quantities computed using bed's CAD area via `core.measurements.calculate_area_and_perimeter`

**Amendment priority**: pH correction first, then N, P, K, then secondary nutrients.

**Integration test** `tests/integration/test_amendment_calculator.py`:
```python
def test_amendment_calc_uses_bed_area(app, qtbot):
    # bed with area 2.0 m², soil pH=5.8, target pH=6.5
    # SoilService.calculate_amendments(...) with dolomite_lime
    # expected qty_g ≈ (6.5-5.8)/0.25*100*2.0 = 560 g
    # assert recommendation.quantity_g == pytest.approx(560, rel=0.05)
```

---

#### US-12.10d: Plant-Soil Compatibility Warnings ✅

**Branch**: `claude/check-clustering-next-steps-E4ReB`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Beds with mismatch: 4 px amber (warning) or red (critical) border rendered in `paint()`
- Hover tooltip: "Soil mismatch: Tomato needs pH 6.5–7.0, current 5.8"
- Dashboard "Today's Tasks": AMBER urgency cards listing each mismatch
- `PlantSpeciesData.n_demand` / `p_demand` / `k_demand` populated for built-in species

**Mismatch rules**:
- pH: `current_ph < plant.ph_min - 0.3` or `current_ph > plant.ph_max + 0.3`
- N: `n_level < 2` and `plant.n_demand == "high"` (Adequate is minimum for heavy feeders)
- P/K: `{p,k}_level < 2` and `plant.{p,k}_demand == "high"`

**Canvas update**: debounced 200 ms `QTimer` in `CanvasScene` (same pattern as spacing circles).
Sets `_soil_mismatch_level: str` on each bed item → read in `paint()`.

**Integration test** `tests/integration/test_plant_soil_warnings.py`

---

#### US-12.10e: History Sparklines & Seasonal Reminder Badge ✅

**Branch**: `feature/US-12.10e-history-and-reminders`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- `SoilTestDialog` "History" tab: scrollable list of past tests + `SoilSparklineWidget` per parameter
- Sparkline: `QPainter` polyline; linear date x-axis; y-axis auto-scaled; dots at each test date
- Seasonal badge: clock icon on bed top-right when `month ∈ {3,4,9,10}` and last test > 180 days ago
- Clicking badge opens `SoilTestDialog` for that bed

**Badge implementation**:
- `SoilBadgeItem(QGraphicsItem)` anchored to bed top-right; updated in `CanvasScene` on scene change
- `mousePressEvent` → emit `soil_test_badge_clicked(bed_id)` signal → `Application` opens dialog

**Integration test** `tests/integration/test_soil_history_and_reminders.py`

---

#### US-12.11: Smart Amendment Composition + User-Toggleable Library + Soil Texture ✅

**Branch**: `claude/roadmap-progress-GwILR`

**Goal**: Make the soil-amendment subsystem usable with the substances people actually own. Real-world fertilizers carry multiple nutrients per bag; the legacy first-pick-per-fix calculator emitted up to three separate rows when one compound product would do. Users on the German market also wanted to disable substances they don't have on hand, plus add structural amendments (sand, perlite, vermiculite, diatomaceous earth) driven by a soil-texture rating.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Amendment library expanded with eight chemical-generic mineral fertilizers (NPK compound 15-6-12, slow-release lawn fertilizer IBDU, potassium-magnesium sulfate, PK with rock phosphate, ammonium sulfate nitrate, single superphosphate, organo-mineral guano tomato fertilizer) and four structural amendments (diatomaceous earth, perlite, vermiculite, coarse silica sand).
- Calculator rewritten as a deficit-map + greedy max-coverage loop: one pick can credit all nutrients it covers (`AmendmentRecommendation.credits`), reducing a typical NPK-deficient row from three substances to one.
- New `SoilTestRecord.soil_texture` field (`sandy` | `loamy` | `clayey` | `compacted` | `None`) drives a structural-pick phase: clayey → drainage + aeration; sandy → water retention; compacted → aeration.
- Amendment Plan dialog hosts an inline collapsible "Available amendments" panel grouping every substance Organic / Mineral / Structural. Toggling a checkbox triggers immediate recompute. `Prefer organic` toggle. `Enable all` button.
- `ProjectData.enabled_amendments: list[str] | None` (default `None` = all enabled) and `ProjectData.prefer_organic: bool` (default `True`) round-trip through the .ogp file via the `shopping_list_prices` pattern; legacy projects load unchanged.
- Soil-test dialog gains a "Soil texture" combo box (Date / Mode / Soil texture row); the inline amendments preview includes structural rows when texture is set.
- All new strings translated (German). i18n test passes.
- New tests cover: multi-nutrient credit, disabled-amendment skip, organic tie-break flip, structural picks for clayey / sandy / loamy soils, ProjectData round-trip, soil_texture round-trip, and the dialog checkbox-toggle integration.

**Implementation files**:
- Data: `src/open_garden_planner/resources/data/amendments.json` (12 → 23 entries)
- Model: `src/open_garden_planner/models/amendment.py` (4 new FIX_* constants, `AmendmentRecommendation.credits`), `src/open_garden_planner/models/soil_test.py` (`soil_texture` field)
- Calculator: `src/open_garden_planner/services/soil_service.py` (`calculate_amendments` rewrite + `_pick_best_coverage`, `_credit_secondaries`, `_structural_fixes_for`, `_pick_structural`, `_compute_structural`)
- Persistence: `src/open_garden_planner/core/project.py` (ProjectData `enabled_amendments` + `prefer_organic`; ProjectManager proxies + signals; new_project / save / load round-trip)
- UI: `src/open_garden_planner/ui/dialogs/amendment_plan_dialog.py` (CollapsiblePanel + checkboxes + Reset + Prefer-organic), `src/open_garden_planner/ui/dialogs/soil_test_dialog.py` (Soil texture combo)
- Aggregation: `src/open_garden_planner/services/shopping_list_service.py` (`aggregate_amendments` accepts `enabled_ids` + `prefer_organic`; `_collect_materials` reads them from ProjectManager)
- Translations: `scripts/fill_translations.py`
- Tests: `tests/integration/test_amendment_calculator.py` (+7 cases), `tests/unit/test_project.py` (+3 cases), `tests/unit/test_soil_test_history_latest.py` (+2 cases)
- Docs: ADR-015 (design rationale), FR-SOIL-11/12/13, glossary entries (Smart composition, Structural amendment, Soil texture, Enabled set / Amendment library)

**Label-verification follow-up**: Three of the eight commercial fertilizer entries carry a label-derived assumption pending bag re-verification — `slow_release_lawn_fertilizer_ibdu` (IBDU vs methylene-urea), `ammonium_sulfate_nitrate` (S vs SO₃ unit), `single_superphosphate` (single vs triple). Documented in `_notes` of `amendments.json`; corrections land via JSON edits without code changes.

## Phase 13: CAD Precision Boost — Package A (v1.11.0)

**Goal**: Close the most-cited CAD precision gaps in one PR — typed coordinate input (relative + polar), two new snap modes (midpoint + intersection) under a unified snap engine, and a Dynamic Input cursor overlay. See ADR-020 (snap engine) and ADR-021 (input pipeline). Bundled as GitHub issue #186.

| Status | US    | Description                                                      |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | A1    | Relative coordinate input `@dx,dy` (status bar + cursor overlay) |
| ✅     | A2    | Polar coordinate input `@dist<angle`                             |
| ✅     | A3    | Midpoint + intersection snap modes, View-menu toggles            |
| ✅     | A4    | Dynamic Input cursor-anchored overlay                            |

### Acceptance highlights
- Smart decimal/separator parsing handles `,` and `.` deterministically across locales (rules A–F in `core/coordinate_input/parser.py`).
- Single shared `CoordinateInputBuffer` keeps status-bar and cursor overlay in sync.
- Snap providers register on a `SnapRegistry` with priority tie-breaking; quadtree pre-filter holds end-to-end snap < 16 ms on 1000-item scenes (perf gate in tests).
- All drawing tools (polyline, polygon, rectangle, circle, ellipse, construction line/circle) accept typed coordinates via `BaseTool.commit_typed_coordinate`.

## Phase 13: CAD Precision Boost — Package B (v1.12.0)

**Goal**: Close the remaining CAD precision gaps in one coordinated release — curve tools (cubic Bezier + 3-point arc), corner editors (fillet + chamfer), and three new reference-point-aware snap modes (nearest, perpendicular, tangent). See ADR-022 (Bezier model + filleted-rectangle conversion) and ADR-023 (snap pipeline v2).

| Status | US    | Description                                                      |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | B1    | Cubic Bezier pen tool (drawing only; placed-curve editing → US-B9) |
| ✅     | B2    | 3-point Arc tool (collinear → polyline fallback)                 |
| ✅     | B3    | Fillet (`Shift+F`) + Chamfer (`Shift+C`) corner editors          |
| ✅     | B4    | Nearest-point fallback snap                                      |
| ✅     | B5    | Perpendicular snap from active tool's `last_point`               |
| ✅     | B6    | Tangent snap onto circles + arcs from `last_point`               |
| ⛔     | B7    | Paper Space MVP — *dropped*; see note below                      |

### US-B7 dropped during manual-test review

US-B7 originally added a "Layout" tab (`Ctrl+4`) with one page / one viewport / title block / scale bar. Manual testing made it clear the abstraction added no user-visible value on top of what `pdf_report_service` already does (multi-page PDF at A4 / A3 / Letter / Legal, with the model rendered at fit-to-page scale and a built-in scale bar). The Layout tab, viewport item, title block, scale bar item, and `paper_layouts` schema were all removed from PR #191 before merge. `FILE_VERSION` stays at 1.4 because the bezier and arc item types — also part of this phase — are still real. The loader silently ignores the `paper_layouts` key it may encounter in `.ogp` files saved by short-lived draft builds of PR #191.

### Package B follow-ups (post-v1.12.0)

Manual testing of PR #191 surfaced follow-up gaps, closed in later PRs:

| Status | US    | Description                                                      |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | B8    | Snap engagements emit *enforceable* constraints + new `TANGENT` type (#192/#196/#197, PR #198, v1.13.0) — see ADR-024 |
| ✅     | B9    | Vertex/handle editing for placed Bezier + Arc (#193) — dedicated `CurveEditMixin` + `CurveControlHandle`, one-undo reshape — see ADR-025 |
| ✅     | B11   | 3-point arc endpoint precision (#195) — exact cubic-Bézier rendering (`arc_to_painter_path`); arc tool reordered to **start → end → bulge** per user feedback |
| ✅     | B4    | Mirror tool (#187 remainder) — reflect selection across a two-click axis (Shift = 45°), Copy/Move; per-type rebuild (`core/mirror_geometry.py`), Move preserves `item_id` so constraints stay bound — see ADR-026. Closes epic #187 |

### Acceptance highlights
- `SnapProvider.candidates()` extended with `reference_point: QPointF | None = None`; all in-tree providers updated atomically; existing tests still green.
- File format `FILE_VERSION` bumped 1.3 → 1.4 to register the new `arc` / `bezier` item types. v1.3 files load unchanged — regression test in place.
- Filleted rectangles convert destructively to polygon-with-arc; undo restores the rectangle (ADR-022).
- Shared `services/scene_rendering.render_scene_region()` helper consolidates PNG export's overlay-hiding / Y-flip / text-scaling bookkeeping into one place. PNG export refactored to use it; SVG export + print dialog migration tracked as follow-up.

### Out of scope (deferred)
- Alt-break-symmetry handles on Bezier (smooth-only in MVP)
- Native DXF export of cubic Beziers (rasterised for now)
- `pdf_report_service` + `print_dialog` migration to `render_scene_region` — only `export_to_png` migrated in this PR; the others land in a follow-up

## Phase 13: Smart Features — Package C (v1.17.0)

**Goal**: Give the plan a single, actionable to-do list. One unified **Tasks** dashboard tab that aggregates every auto-derived action — planting-calendar windows, succession sow/clear, soil amendments, frost protection — plus user-created manual tasks, with persistent done / snooze / dismiss state. See ADR-029 (pure generators + render-time status + dual-store coexistence) and FR-21.

| Status | US    | Description                                                      |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | C1    | Harvest tracking / yield log (#188) — per-plant/bed log + garden-wide dashboard — see FR-23 |
| ✅     | C2    | Task management & reminders — unified Tasks tab (#188) — see ADR-029 |

### US-C1 acceptance highlights

- **"Log Harvest…"** on any plant/bed context menu opens `HarvestLogDialog` (Entry + History tabs); each entry stores date, quantity, editable unit (kg/g/pcs/bunch/L), quality, notes, optional photo. History groups past entries by year with per-unit subtotals. Mirrors the pest-log architecture (US-12.7).
- **Undoable** Add/Edit/Delete (`Add/Edit/DeleteHarvestRecordCommand`); records persist under the additive `.ogp` key `harvest_logs` keyed by item UUID (no `FILE_VERSION` bump). Each `HarvestHistory` caches `species_key`/`species_name` so totals resolve even after the plant is deleted.
- **Garden-wide Harvest dashboard tab** (Ctrl+6 — Ctrl+5 since #310, appended via `indexOf` so existing shortcuts/badges are untouched) shows per-species/per-year/per-unit totals from the pure, Qt-free `services/harvest_aggregation.aggregate_by_species_year` (different units never summed); double-click a row selects that species on the canvas. **CSV export** + optional **PDF "Harvest summary"** page.
- **Journal link**: each harvest auto-creates a **pin-less** `harvest`-tagged `JournalNote` (new `JournalNote.tags`) so it appears in the Garden Journal without a canvas pin; Add/Edit/Delete keep it in sync and undo restores both. The journal note dialog preserves `tags` so editing never strips the marker.
- **Season rollover**: harvest history carries forward (year-over-year totals survive rotation); carried records have their `journal_note_id` severed since the new season starts with a blank journal.

### US-C2 acceptance highlights

- **Unified Tasks tab** (Ctrl+5 — Ctrl+4 since #310, appended after Seed Inventory via `indexOf` so existing shortcuts/badges are untouched) groups tasks Overdue / Today / This Week / Upcoming / No date, with collapsible **Snoozed** and **Done** sections.
- **Auto-generated tasks** come from six pure, Qt-free `(PlanState) -> list[Task]` generators (`services/task_generator.py`): planting-calendar windows, propagation steps, succession sow/clear, one soil-amendment task per recommendation per bed, frost protection (from the weather service's frost alerts), and manual tasks; `generate_all` flat-maps + dedups by `task_id`.
- **Manual tasks** (`models/task.py` `ManualTask`: date, title, notes, optional bed link) are created/edited via `TaskDialog`; Add/Edit/Delete are undoable.
- **Status is render-time** (`services/task_status.effective_status`): open / snoozed / done / dismissed / archived computed against "today" — no scheduler; expired snoozes reappear, done > 7 days auto-archives.
- **Additive persistence**: new `.ogp` keys `manual_tasks` + `task_states`, no `FILE_VERSION` bump; older files load with empty dicts and legacy `task_completions` is folded to archived-done on load.
- **Dual-store coexistence → converged (#228)**: the original design had `set_task_status` and `set_task_completion` both write `task_states` and the legacy `task_completions` done-set so the (untouched) planting-calendar dashboard stayed consistent with the Tasks tab. The convergence follow-up (#228) retired that: the calendar dashboard now generates its rows from the same `generate_all(build_plan_state(...))` engine and reads `effective_status`, `set_task_completion` delegates to `set_task_status` (single write-path), soil-mismatch is a shared generator on both surfaces, and the calendar refresh was debounced + wired to `stack_changed` (fixing #225's undo/redo staleness). `task_completions` remains only as a write-only `.ogp` compat mirror.
- **Navigate-to-bed** from a task selects/centres the linked bed/species/items on the Garden Plan tab; frost tasks reuse the planting calendar's single weather fetch (`frost_alerts_ready`) — no second forecast request.

## UI/UX: Sidebar Accordion (issue #226)

**Goal**: Declutter the right sidebar. Replace the static stack of 9 always-expanded panels with a hover-peek + click-to-pin accordion.

| Status | Issue | Description                                                      |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | #226  | Hover-peek + click-to-pin sidebar accordion — see ADR-030       |

### Acceptance highlights (revised after manual test — ADR-030 addendum)
- All panels **collapsed at startup** every session (no pin/panel-state persistence).
- **Hover** a bar → peeks open in place (reflow pushes bars below down); leave → collapses (asymmetric debounce, no flicker on fast sweeps).
- **Click** title → toggles open/closed, **animated** (organic height expansion). Panels keep a **fixed order** — opening one never reorders the list.
- Open panels **fill the available space** (content-weighted) instead of leaving an empty gap: one open panel fills the sidebar; several share the surplus by content size; combined overflow **scrolls**. (Equal-share + draggable dividers from the first cut were dropped.)
- Selecting a plant auto-opens Plant Details + Companion; selecting a bed auto-opens Crop Rotation; clearing closes them. An auto-opened panel is **closable with one click** and stays closed for that selection; a different selection re-opens it. Manually-opened panels survive a selection clear.
- New `SidebarController` (`ui/widgets/panel_stack.py`) owns the layout + `PanelState`/`PinSource` machine: one `QVBoxLayout` in a `QScrollArea`, panels never reparented.
- First cut used a bottom `QSplitter` (reparent-on-pin) — reworked after manual testing surfaced reordering, no animation, and unclosable selection panels.

## Canvas: Per-object stacking order (issue #338)

**Goal**: Add CAD-standard *Bring to Front / Bring Forward / Send Backward / Send to Back* for selected objects, reachable from the right-click context menu, the Properties panel, and keyboard shortcuts — reordering objects **within their own layer only**, with multi-selection keeping relative order and a bed's contained plants moving as one block.

| Status | Issue | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ | #338 | Per-object stacking order within a layer — see ADR-043 / FR-31 / §8.25 (shipped v1.27.3, PR #340) |

### Acceptance highlights
- **Sparse rank + derived z** — a new `stack_order: int | None` sort key (`STACK_STEP = 1024`) replaces the old all-items-tie-at-`layer.z_order*100` scheme. z is never stored as intent: `CanvasScene._normalized_layer_order`/`_refresh_layer_z` derive it fresh from the current ranks as `layer.z_order*100 + 100*(i+1)/(n+1)`, strictly inside the layer's own band so it can never collide with a fixed overlay z (dimension lines, tool previews, the soil badge, the minimap cutoff — §8.25's reserved-band table; journal pins are their own rank-carrying document item, not a fixed band — see §8.25.6). Ranks are written in exactly four places (`CanvasScene.addItem`, `MoveToLayerCommand`, `ArrangeItemsCommand`, and the post-load renumber when `suspend_z_refresh(renumber=True)` exits) — the refresh itself never writes one, which is what keeps every command's undo snapshot exact.
- **Derive-only clamp for beds and roof ridges** — `core/stacking.py::normalize_order` reorders (never re-ranks) a plant to sit immediately above its parent bed, and a `ROOF_RIDGE` immediately above its owner polygon, only when that parent is itself in the same layer. "Send to Back" on a lone plant stops just above its bed rather than reaching the true bottom, and correctly reports "already at back" when it's already there.
- **One apply seam** — `ui/canvas/arrange.py::build_arrange_command` is the only place that groups a selection by layer and asks the Qt-free `core/stacking.py::arrange` what changes; the Edit ▸ Arrange menu, every item's `Arrange ▸` context-menu submenu (9 shared-seam shapes via `GardenItemMixin`), the Properties panel's Arrange row (single + multi-selection), and the Agent API's `arrange_object` tool all call it — the same discipline `ui/canvas/geometry_apply.py` established for resize/rotate, for the same reason (a copy-per-call-site pattern is how earlier rotated-geometry bugs happened).
- **Undo story** — exactly one `ArrangeItemsCommand` per gesture, however many layers or block members it touches; a no-op (already at front/back, or nothing to step past) pushes nothing onto the undo stack and reports the reason via status message instead.
- **Persistence story, and a real bug fixed en passant** — `.ogp` save order flips from Qt's top-first `scene.items()` to bottom→top, fixing a **proven, pre-existing bug**: every save/load round-trip had silently inverted same-layer stacking (only the plant/bed and roof-ridge cases were band-aided). The new `stack_order` key is additive; `FILE_VERSION` is unchanged. A file without the key loads in file order and gets honest ranks on first load by the new app; the write-order fix benefits *older* app versions too, since they simply read file order.
- **Two design-review catches before anything shipped**: a first draft had the z-refresh also renumber ranks as a side effect — rejected because a refresh runs on many unrelated paths and would silently invalidate a command's undo snapshot taken before it; a second draft assigned a provisional z at add time to be finalized lazily — rejected because it breaks the moment items are deleted from the middle of a layer. Both are recorded as rejected alternatives in ADR-043.
- **Clipboard fix found along the way** — copy/duplicate previously produced layer-less pasted items (no `layer_id` was ever saved to the clipboard dict); paste now carries and validates `layer_id` against the target scene, falling back to the active layer.
- **Bulk-add performance** — `CanvasScene.suspend_z_refresh()` (a context manager, `renumber=True` on the load path) defers the per-add z-refresh across a batch instead of doing one O(layer-size) refresh per item; measured, a 50-item paste into a 2000-object plan went from 316 ms to 91 ms.
- **Agent parity** — the token-gated `arrange_object(item_id, action)` write tool calls the identical seam (bed block and plant clamp included) and refuses a no-op rather than reporting a false success; `ObjectRef`/`ObjectDetail` gain a read-only `stack_index` (0-based, bottom→top, per layer), and `list_objects`/`objects_in_region`/`get_object` are now documented as bottom→top in stacking order (`get_diagnostics` is explicitly not).
- Journal pins stay unarrangeable (no context-menu entry, GUI no-op, agent refusal); arcs/beziers are arrangeable via menu/shortcut but have no context-menu entry (they never had a Move-to-Layer one either).

## Google Maps packaged-build follow-up (Issue #342)

Shipped in v1.27.5 via [PR #344](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/344): the satellite picker now accepts a Google Maps API key from Preferences, while retaining the environment/adjacent-`.env` fallback for source and packaged builds. Preferences values take precedence, blank values fall back, and credentials are excluded from project files and artifacts. Worker shutdown is asynchronous across picker rejection, window close, and application shutdown. See ADR-019, FR-IMG-08, and §8.15.

## Satellite import redesign around the Maps JavaScript API (Issue #346)

Shipped 2026-09-01 in v1.27.6 via [PR #348](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/348): for projects Google's EEA terms restrict (Static Maps API rejects `satellite`/`hybrid` with a canonical 403), the picker now offers — and always provides — a **JS-API view capture**: the live map is positioned over the drawn rectangle, the `QWebEngineView` is grabbed at the widget level (no DOM access, no tile harvesting; tile URLs embed the key and taint canvases — html2canvas is structurally dead), and the image is cropped and scaled with the same analytic math plus a baked attribution strip. `FetchResult` gains `source`/`attribution` provenance and `geo_metadata` persists the additive keys. See ADR-019 addendum, FR-IMG-08/FR-IMG-10, §6.3.1, §11.4, and the unit/integration suites in `test_google_maps_js_capture.py` / `test_map_picker_capture.py`. Pan-grid stitching for higher resolution is follow-up [Issue #347](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/347).

## Pan-grid view capture for higher resolution (Issue #347)

Shipped 2026-09-02 in v1.27.7 via [PR #350](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/350): the JS-API view capture now raises its resolution ceiling to the Static mosaic's level. The capture is a **pan grid** — a capture-profile phase pins the real viewport + dpr, then the page pans the map across a `cols × rows` (≤ 3×3) grid of viewport positions at one integer zoom and Python grabs and stitches each frame. Seams are eliminated analytically: frame centres sit a whole number of world/css pixels apart (identical sub-pixel phase) and steps are dpr-aligned so `stitch_frames` pastes at integer grabbed-pixel offsets with no overlap. `pick_capture_zoom_and_grid` mirrors the Static `pick_zoom_and_grid` (single-frame capture is the degenerate 1×1 grid — one engine). Per-frame render failures retry twice, then fail cleanly; a mid-capture resize is refused; the stitched mosaic carries exactly one baked attribution strip. `FetchResult` and `geo_metadata` are unchanged. See ADR-019 addendum #347, FR-IMG-11, §6.3.1, §11.4, and the extended unit/integration suites (numerical stitch verification reconstructs a synthetic world image pixel-perfectly). The one real-key assumption (Google's rasterizer phase-determinism between whole-css-px pans) is on the manual-test checklist.

## Build provenance attestation for release artifacts (Issue #356)

Shipped 2026-09-15 in v1.27.9 via [PR #357](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/357): Windows Defender flagged the installer as `Trojan:Script/Wacatac.C!ml` — a known PyInstaller/Defender false-positive pattern, worsened by the installer being unsigned (issue #89, closed not_planned — no budget for a paid Authenticode cert). `release.yml` now attests build provenance (`actions/attest-build-provenance`, Sigstore-backed, no paid cert) for the installer, the raw app exe it packages, and `SHA256SUMS.txt`, so anyone can independently verify with `gh attestation verify` that a release artifact was built by this project's public CI from a specific public commit. This proves source provenance, not Authenticode signing — SmartScreen/Defender warnings can still appear. See ADR-044, §11.1, §11.2.

## Manual-pass follow-up: four defects (#373, #377, #378, #380)

Shipped together in one PR. Four defects found while dogfooding the agent tooling and the D3.2 manual pass.

| Status | Issue | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| ✅ | #377 | **Tool previews drew behind beds.** Every shape tool's in-progress preview primitive kept Qt's default `z = 0` while real items get a derived z inside `(0, 100)`, so the dashed preview was invisible whenever the gesture overlapped a bed. Fixed by the new `core/tools/preview_z.py`, which holds the reserved preview band (`999`–`1002`, below the minimap's `10000` cutoff) for the 11 modules that build a preview. The issue's own module list was incomplete: it omitted `construction_tool.py` and wrongly included three modules that build no preview item at all; a drift guard re-derives the set from source. See §8.25.6, §11.4. |
| ✅ | #378 | **Crop-rotation panel ignored an existing succession plan.** A bed could show a succession badge while the panel beside it said "every crop is suitable". The panel now shows a display-only **"Planned This Season"** section (planned crops with their botanical family, clearly *not* history) and an explicit message when there is a plan but no history. `CropRotationService` is unchanged — the plan is deliberately **not** fed into `get_recommendation`, which would change the 3-year cooldown for every caller (the rejected option in the issue). See ADR-036 addendum. |
| ✅ | #373 | **App shutdown waited ~10 s for the Agent API thread.** Root-caused with instrumentation: an MCP client holding the SSE stream open never closes it, and uvicorn's graceful shutdown waits for open connections, so `serve()` never returned and both 5 s joins expired. Fixed by cancelling the loop's tasks and stopping the loop directly on `stop()` (measured 10.03 s → 0.58 s with a streaming client; 0.00 s without). `force_exit` alone did **not** fix it. See §11.4. |
| ✅ | #380 | **Agent writes were not canvas-clamped.** The GUI clamps objects to the canvas at five sites; the agent path did not, so `create_object`/`move_object` could strand an object entirely off-plan where it was invisible and un-deletable. New Qt-free `core/canvas_bounds.py` holds the rule once, called by both the GUI drag paths and the agent paths, so they cannot drift. Adds `ObjectRef.outside_canvas` and a `get_diagnostics` kind `outside_canvas` so an already-saved off-plan object is discoverable. This is a deliberate reversal of the earlier "stage an object just off-plan" rationale. See ADR-036 addendum, FR-AGENT-26, §8.19. |

## Phase 13: Agent Integration — Package D (MCP Server) — Complete (v1.29.1, PR #382)

**Goal**: Expose the garden plan to AI agents (Claude, Cursor, any MCP client) so they can read, visualise, export, and — behind the explicit write gate — edit it. The running app embeds a **Model Context Protocol server over streamable-HTTP** on `127.0.0.1` (on by default for reads, loopback-only; toggle to disable). D1 shipped the read/visualise/export surface; D2.0–D2.6 shipped the token-gated creation, domain editing, layer, global-history, and low-level geometry tools; D3.1/D3.2 shipped earlier; D3.3/D3.4 shipped in v1.29.1 via PR #382, completing Package D and closing epic #237. See ADR-033/034/036, FR-26, §8.19, and GitHub epic #237.

### Design decisions (from the planning session)
| Axis | Decision |
|------|----------|

### Phasing
| Phase | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| **D1 (v1, MVP)** | Write-ready core + read/query tools + render-image tool + export tools + resources + read-analysis prompts |
| **D2** | Write/edit tools (create/move/resize/delete beds, containers, plants, shapes; assign species; layers; global undo/redo) — auto-apply, one-undo-per-op, free co-edit; low-level geometry escape hatches. **Prerequisite: token auth** (FR-AGENT-03 / §8.11) landed with D2.0. **D2.0 ✅ shipped** the token gate + first write slice (`move_object`/`delete_object`, ADR-036); **D2.1 ✅ shipped** `create_object` (plants + soil containers); **D2.2 ✅ shipped** `resize_object`/`rotate_object` plus the canonical `ui/canvas/geometry_apply` path; **D2.3 ✅ shipped** `set_species`/`set_parent_bed`; **D2.4 ✅ shipped** `list_layers` and layer writes; **D2.5 ✅ shipped** loader-backed shape/structure creation and discovery; **D2.6 ✅ shipped** `get_geometry`, absolute positioning, and polygon/polyline vertex writes. The #353–#355 hardening package adds same-scene load cleanup, fail-closed delete, MCP history, bounded callout input, and a median performance guard. All scene writes remain behind the same ADR-036 double gate. |

| Status | US | Description |
| ------ | -- | ----------- |
| ✅ | D1.1 | **Embedded MCP server core** (spike) — streamable-HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:<port>` on a background asyncio thread; **on by default (read-only)**, Settings toggle to disable; `MainThreadBridge` marshaling boundary; `get_plan_summary` tracer tool; `mcp`/`uvicorn` bundled into the exe (frozen-server verified). See ADR-033/034, FR-26, §8.19. *(PR #239)* |
| ✅ | D1.2 | **Read/query tools** (v1.22.0, PR #241) — `list_objects`/`get_object` (UUID-addressed, curated schema + `raw=True`), spatial queries (`objects_in_region`, `objects_in`, `plants_in_bed`, `nearest_objects`, `measure_distance`), `get_diagnostics` (companion/spacing/soil/capacity/crop-rotation, reads already-computed warnings). Qt-free `queries.py`/`diagnostics.py` over `snapshot_dict`; `AgentProviders` bundle. No FILE_VERSION change. See ADR-034 addendum, §8.19, FR-AGENT-06/07/08. |
| ✅ | D1.3 | **Vision tool** (v1.23.0, PR #242) — `render_canvas_image(x?, y?, width?, height?, layers?, image_width_px?)` returns a PNG of the live canvas + `RenderMeta`, reusing `services/scene_rendering.render_scene_region` (the same pipeline `ExportService.export_to_png`/the PDF report already use). New Qt-touching `agent_api/render.py`; `resolve_image_pixel_size` double-clamps width + derived height to `[128, 2048]`; `AgentProviders.render` is the first parametrized provider (one atomic main-thread hop). Two facts empirically verified against mcp 1.28.1: `Image` isn't pydantic-representable (`@mcp.tool(structured_output=False)` required, plus `Image` must be a genuine top-level import in `server.py`, not function-local) and `render_scene_region`'s `y_flip=True` inverts the rendered pixel Y-axis relative to D1.2's scene frame (correction formula on `RenderMeta.px_per_cm`). **Manual-test fix:** `layers` was originally subtractive-only — a layer the user had toggled off live stayed invisible even when explicitly requested; `_hidden_layers_not_in` now forces the full requested visibility set and restores the original state afterward. Independent review: no P0/P1s, three P2 nits addressed. No FILE_VERSION change. See ADR-034 addendum, §8.19, FR-AGENT-09. |
| ✅ | D1.4 | **Export/save tools** (v1.24.0, PR #243) — `save_plan(file_path?)`, `export_pdf(file_path?, paper_size?, orientation?)`, `export_dxf(file_path?)`, `export_csv(kind, file_path?)`, the first Agent API tools with a filesystem side effect — each calls the exact same service the GUI's File > Export/Save menu already uses, no new export logic. New `agent_api/exports.py`: `resolve_export_path` reuses the `app/paths.py` #199/#204 safe-path chokepoint when no path is given, else force-applies the suffix and requires the parent directory already exist. `save_plan` with no path and no project open raises rather than inventing a filename; given a path it becomes the project's file going forward, mirroring `application._save_to_file` exactly (incl. the issue-#178 stale shopping-list-price prune). No token auth needed — none of the four can make an edit an agent isn't otherwise capable of. Independent review found two P1s (both fixed): `previous_file_path` returning the literal string `"None"` instead of JSON `null` on a first save-as, and `paper_size`/`orientation` not being `Literal`-typed. **Bonus fix found while verifying the frozen exe:** `installer/ogp.spec` excluded `"unittest"`, silently breaking DXF export/import in any freshly-built exe (`ezdxf` → `pyparsing.testing` → `unittest` at import time) — not just this PR's `export_dxf`. Real-world dogfood test (an independent Claude instance driving the live MCP server) confirmed all four tools end-to-end. No FILE_VERSION change. See ADR-034 addendum, §8.19, FR-AGENT-10. |
| ✅ | D1.5 | **Resources + prompts** (issue #249) — 5 read-only resources: `garden://plan` (curated `PlanSummary`), `garden://plan/raw` (uncurated snapshot dict), `garden://canvas.png` (full-canvas PNG, no region/layer args), `garden://diagnostics`, `garden://species` (bundled species DB, 118 records — no `AgentProviders` field needed, `services/bundled_species_db.py` is Qt-free); 2 read-analysis prompts: `audit-plan`, `describe-garden` (new Qt-free `agent_api/prompts.py`, pure text builders over the existing schema types). Almost entirely registration/wiring over D1.1–D1.4's existing building blocks. Verified directly against the installed `mcp==1.28.1` source (not assumed): resources need none of the tool-only `Image`/`structured_output=False` workaround — a `bytes` return + `mime_type="image/png"` on `@mcp.resource()` produces a `BlobResourceContents` automatically, and non-str/bytes returns (pydantic models, dicts, lists) auto-serialize via `pydantic_core.to_json`. No `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-034 addendum, §8.19, FR-AGENT-11. |
| ✅ | D1.6 | **AI client onboarding** (issue #240) — in-app "Connect your AI assistant" helper, reached from Help → "Connect AI Assistant…" and Preferences → Agent API: shows/copies the connect URL, **detects installed clients** by their known config locations, and one-click registers the server where each client's own docs support a safe automatic path — **Cursor** (direct JSON merge into `~/.cursor/mcp.json`), **Claude Code** (`claude mcp add --transport http --scope user` CLI, preferred over hand-editing `~/.claude.json`'s nested schema). **Claude Desktop is detection-only** (verified against `modelcontextprotocol.io`'s own docs: its local config only documents stdio servers; a plain local HTTP endpoint is registered through the app's own Settings → Connectors → "Add custom connector" UI, not a config file — auto-writing a guessed schema, or reaching for the `mcp-remote` npm bridge workaround, was rejected as unnecessary risk). Every client, detected or not, also gets a copy-paste snippet + a short "where to put this" note. New Qt-free `services/ai_client_onboarding.py` introduces this codebase's **first atomic-write pattern** (temp file + `os.replace`, backup-before-overwrite, preserves every other key/server) since every prior JSON writer here only ever wrote its own file. Three senior-review rounds: round 1 caught an unguarded `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`/`OSError` from the Claude Code CLI call reaching the Qt slot uncaught; round 2 caught the resulting install having zero visual feedback despite up to ~45s of blocking CLI calls (added a WaitCursor + button-disable, mirroring `preferences_dialog._test_api`'s existing precedent for a blocking call); round 3 caught the deeper bug those two obscured — the Preferences entry point derived its connect URL from settings/widget state rather than asking whether the server was actually **running**, so a saved-but-dead port (e.g. a `PortInUseError` at launch) would have been silently registered as if it worked. Fixed by adding one shared `GardenPlannerApp.agent_api_running_url()` accessor both the Help menu and Preferences entry points now call — the only source of truth is "is the server actually up," never a reconstruction. No token auth needed (registering a client isn't scene-mutating); no `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-035, §8.19, FR-AGENT-12. |
| ✅ | D2.1 | **Agent object creation** (v1.26.3, PR [#290](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/290)) — `create_object(object_type, x, y, width?, height?, radius?, name?, species?)` behind the D2.0 double gate. Slice scope = plants (`TREE`/`SHRUB`/`PERENNIAL`, radius optional → the gallery-drop defaults 100/50/30 cm) + soil containers (`GARDEN_BED`/`RAISED_BED`/`CONTAINER`/`WALL_PLANTER` rectangular, `CONTAINER_ROUND` round, radius required). Coordinates are **centres** in the read tools' own Y-up frame; the rectangle centre→anchor conversion (`anchor = centre − extent/2`) is frame-agnostic by construction. Items are built by the loader's own `_deserialize_item_core`, so there is no second construction path to drift from the serializer. Mirrors the GUI gallery-drop orchestration in full: bundled-species auto-populate, the US-E8 planting-date stamp on **every** new plant (species or not), and active-layer assignment. **Investigation finding:** the initial design assumed the GUI never links a dropped plant to its bed and planned an explicit reconcile — a probe of the real path disproved it. `CreateItemCommand.execute` already calls `_auto_parent_plant` (and `undo` calls `_detach_from_parent`), so the bed link rides *inside* the one create step; the reconcile was removed as dead code and `create_object` is **always exactly one undo step** (unlike `move_object`, whose `MoveItemsCommand` has no such hook). Refuses (leaving scene + undo stack untouched) on an out-of-slice type, a dimension that doesn't fit the shape, a missing/zero/negative extent, a non-finite number, or a locked active layer. New Qt-free `agent_api/creates.py` (validation + `.ogp`-dict building) with drift guards on its inlined `ObjectType` name sets. No `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-036 (D2.1 addendum), FR-AGENT-14. |
| ✅ | D2.2 | **Agent resize + rotate, and the canonical geometry-apply path** (PR [#335](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/335), issue [#326](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/326)) — `resize_object(item_id, width?, height?, radius?)` (absolute target dimensions in cm; **the object's scene centre is preserved for every type**) and `rotate_object(item_id, angle, relative?)` (degrees, **positive = counter-clockwise**, absolute by default, normalised to `[0, 360)`) behind the D2.0 double gate. The load-bearing half is the extraction: `ResizeItemCommand`/`RotateItemCommand` take a caller-supplied `apply_func`, so every call site had its own closure — the panel's three numeric-entry branches plus a drag-release handler per item class — and adding the agent would have made another. New `ui/canvas/geometry_apply.py` is now the single apply path for every **rect-backed** resize, with the two anchor policies as one parameter and `pos` solved through `resize_handle.anchored_position`/`scene_point_of` (the transform pair extracted from #218's `resize_rect_item_keeping_anchor` so the mutating primitive and the undo-record builders share one formula). `apply_rotation` now has exactly **one** definition in the codebase, drift-guarded. The authoritative list of callers — and of the two deliberate exceptions — is that module's own docstring, stated **there only**: during review five paraphrases of it drifted into three inconsistent answers, which is the very failure the extraction exists to prevent. **The extraction exposed three live GUI bugs, none of them introduced here**, all invisible at rotation 0 and all growing with angle: the panel's copies never re-pinned `transformOriginPoint` (**73.2 cm** displacement for a 30° / 50→100 cm case); `_move_corner_to` had the same omission (**331 cm** between the stored and visible centres); and the EQUAL-constraint partner appliers solved for `pos` as if unrotated (**70.7 cm** at 90°). Senior review caught the last two — and caught that the first fix for the corner drag was a *swap*, trading the save-time bug for a 671 cm interaction bug, because it re-pinned the origin without re-deriving the `pos` that depended on it. The rotation sign was **measured against a real item, then documented, then pinned** against a corner position (never the stored angle) — the #267 lesson applied prospectively. Refuses vertex-backed objects by name (polygons/polylines — vertex editing is US-D2.6), plus D2.0's constrained/pin/group/locked-layer list via a new shared `_agent_require_unconstrained`. Qt-free validation in `agent_api/edits.py` with drift guards. One undo step each. No `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-036 (D2.2 addendum), FR-AGENT-15, §8.19, §11.4. |
| ✅ | D2.3 | **Agent species assignment + explicit bed reparenting** (PR [#335](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/335), issue [#327](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/327)) — `set_species(item_id, species?, apply_database_size?)` and `set_parent_bed(item_id, bed_id?)` behind the same gate, closing the two gaps that only existed for objects that already exist. `set_species` resolves the name against the bundled DB through the same resolver `create_object` uses and delegates to **`ui/plant_species_assignment.apply_species_to_item`** — the #213 helper the plant panel and species search already share — so the agent is a third *caller*, not a third implementation. **The issue's premise about `apply_database_size` was wrong and the code corrected it**: the app always adopts the species' `max_spread_cm` footprint silently, asking only when a manual spacing override conflicts, so the flag defaults to **`True`** and is the agent's answer to that dialog rather than a "don't resize" switch — defaulting it to `False` as specified would have made the agent behave differently from the GUI on the common path. The D2.1 asymmetry (creation sizes from gallery defaults because `radius` is an explicit parameter a species must not overrule) is **decided and documented**, with `create_object` → `set_species` as the stated two-step for database sizing. `set_parent_bed` is a link change only — the plant does not move — reaching the one state `move_object` cannot: a plant already inside a bed drawn around it. It deliberately does **not** require geometric containment (neither does the app's Link action) and reports `link_is_geometric` instead. `TRELLIS` is accepted as a plant parent though it is not a soil container (§8.14/ADR-017); a `HOUSE` is refused by name with the valid options listed. Undo restores the plant's original z. One undo step each. No `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-036 (D2.3 addendum), FR-AGENT-16, §8.19. |
| ✅ | D2.4 | **Layer tools** (v1.27.8, PR [#352](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/352), issue [#328](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/328)) — curated UUID-addressed `Layer` records and `list_layers`; `set_object_layer`, `create_layer`, `rename_layer`, `delete_layer`, `set_active_layer`, and visibility/opacity writes reuse the existing layer commands and one-undo contract. **Layer locking is agent-writable in both directions since issue #365** — a deliberate policy reversal of the original decision, recorded as such rather than as a bug: `set_layer_property(layer_id, locked=...)` locks and unlocks through the same `SetLayerPropertyCommand` the Layers panel uses. The *object-level* protection is unchanged and still tests the layer's current lock state, so agents still may not delete a locked layer, move objects onto it, or edit its objects; "unlock, then edit" is simply two ordinary undoable calls. `set_active_layer` is session state and has no undo step. See ADR-034/036 addenda, FR-AGENT-17, §8.19. |
| ✅ | D2.5 | **`create_object` for shapes & structures** (v1.27.8, PR [#352](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/352), issue [#329](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/329)) — loader-backed circle, rectangle, ellipse, polygon, polyline, and callout families with native Y-up vertices, a machine-readable `list_creatable_types` roster, and a full `ObjectType` drift guard. `HOUSE` creates its linked `ROOF_RIDGE` in one undo step; direct ridge, journal-pin, generic-text, and legacy hedge-section creation are explicit refusals under the approved contract recorded in the issue-237 implementation session. See ADR-036, FR-AGENT-18, §8.19. |
| ✅ | D2-H1 | **Live MCP QA hardening** ([#353](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/353)) — shipped in v1.27.10 via PR #360: same-scene load removes every serialized document item so layer counts and object enumeration agree; duplicate UUIDs fail closed; concurrent deletes are deterministic; authenticated `undo`/`redo` operate one command at a time on the global GUI stack. Covered by real-client integration tests. |
| ✅ | D2-H2 | **Bounded callout input** ([#355](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/355)) — shipped in v1.27.10 via PR #360: signed offsets are finite and canvas-relative (`abs(offset) <= 2 * max(canvas_width, canvas_height)`) before Qt construction; explicit null/non-finite/oversized input leaves scene and history untouched. Covered through the real MCP transport. |
| ✅ | D2-H3 | **CI performance calibration** ([#354](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/354)) — shipped in v1.27.10 via PR #360: spatial-index test uses warm-up plus repeated median samples (200 ms build / 1 ms query) instead of one noisy wall-clock sample; no spatial-index implementation change. Isolated in its own test/CI commit. |
| ✅ | D2-H4 | **Document lifecycle + layer-lock reversal** ([#365](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/365)) — `new_plan(width_cm?, height_cm?, force?)` and `open_plan(file_path, force?)`, so an agent is not limited to whatever plan the user happens to have open. Both are **token-gated like `delete_object`** — not merely because they mutate, but because they can discard unsaved work — and both reuse the GUI's own paths (`_on_new_project` extracted into `_new_project_document`; `_open_project_file` split into a raising `_load_project_file` plus its modal-reporting GUI wrapper, so an agent never gets a `QMessageBox` on its behalf). Each refuses on a dirty plan unless `force=true`, because the GUI asks the user there and an agent cannot. `new_plan` refuses an out-of-range canvas rather than clamping it. Plus the **layer-lock policy reversal**: `set_layer_property(locked=...)` now works both ways, with the object-level guards deliberately left absolute. See ADR-034 addendum, FR-AGENT-22, §8.19. |
| ✅ | D1.6a | **Generalized client onboarding** ([#366](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/366)) — clients become **registry data** rather than `if`/`elif` branches: one frozen `ClientTarget` per client, with `container_key` (`mcpServers` / `mcp_servers` / the nested `mcp.servers`), `syntax` (`json` / `jsonc` / `toml`) and `entry`/`cli_argv` as independent fields, so the dialog gained three new clients (**OpenCode, Codex, Gemini CLI**) with **no UI change**. Backup / atomic-replace / fail-closed / foreign-key preservation now exist once, keyed on syntax. **TOML is appended surgically** (`tomllib` reads, one table's line span is rewritten) because a full re-serialise would destroy the user's own comments in a file OGP does not own — **no new dependency**. **The read-only connect URL is the default hand-out**, closing a real leak: the single "Copy URL" button used to copy the *write-enabled* URL, so the default thing a user pasted into a chat was a live credential. Clients also report **detected / registered / stale**, so a rotated token or changed port surfaces instead of silently failing. See ADR-035 addendum, FR-AGENT-12a. |

| ✅ | D2.7 | **History introspection** ([#362](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/362)) — unauthenticated read-only `get_history` reports `undo_depth` / `redo_depth` / `next_undo_text` / `next_redo_text` from the same global LIFO stack Ctrl+Z mutates, and never mutates it. This makes two of D2's core invariants machine-checkable with no human reading a menu: "one call = one undo step" (including the documented two-step reparent case) and "a refusal leaves the scene **and** the stack untouched" — previously a write that pushed a command while leaving the scene byte-identical passed every available check. Qt-free (`agent_api/history.py`, behind a Protocol); read-only, no token-gate change, no `FILE_VERSION` change. See FR-AGENT-24, §8.19. |
| ✅ | D2.6 | **Low-level geometry escape hatches** ([#330](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/330)) — unauthenticated `get_geometry` reports the stable live scene-frame geometry and every referencing constraint; token-gated `set_object_position`, `set_vertex`, `add_vertex`, and `delete_vertex` provide absolute placement and polygon/polyline topology edits. Each actual vertex mutation is one canonical command/undo step; an unchanged request is refused as a no-op rather than adding an empty undo entry, and scene/local conversion reuses the exact current point so inverse-transform noise cannot look like a mutation; minimum 3/2-vertex shapes are enforced by the item protocol. The constraint decision is permanent refusal, made legible by `get_geometry` rather than silently skipping the live multi-item solver. No `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-036 D2.6 addendum, FR-AGENT-21, §8.19. |
| ✅ | D3.1 | **Companion tools** ([#319](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/319)) — unauthenticated read-only `suggest_companions` / `find_compatible_sets` / `check_placement` + the `plan-polyculture-bed` prompt, plus a Companion-panel "Suggest a compatible set…" action. Sets are maximal Bron–Kerbosch cliques over the beneficial companion graph with antagonist pairs as hard exclusions; `size` is a floor, output deterministic, candidates capped at 60 and results at 50. **The panel and the prompt do not pass the bed as `must_include`** — that is measurably wrong (0 sets for 91% of two-plant and 100% of three-plant beds), because Bron–Kerbosch emits only maximal cliques, so `find_sets_for_bed()` instead ranks sets by how much of the bed they keep and names the plants that clash. `check_placement` resolves the bed itself and reports `unknown_bed` rather than a clean-looking `neutral`; spacing/soil are `null` (use `get_diagnostics`). No token, no `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-045, FR-AGENT-23, §8.19. |
| ✅ | D3.2 | **Succession tools** ([#331](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/331)) - unauthenticated read-only `get_succession_plan` / `find_succession_gaps` / `suggest_succession` plus the token-gated `set_succession_plan`, and the `plan-succession` prompt. **First agent write into `ProjectData` rather than the scene graph**, so it has no geometry, no badge and no `geometry_apply.py`: the canvas refresh comes from the already-wired `succession_plans_changed` signal chain rather than a duplicated call, and the refusal contract matters MORE because a half-applied write would corrupt a *stored* plan with nothing on screen to reveal it. Four corrections to the issue's own spec shipped with it: there are **four** season segments (`early_spring`/`late_spring`/`summer`/`fall`), not the three the issue described; the no-location month-based fallback was **extracted** from the succession dialog into `models/succession.py` so the GUI and an agent cannot disagree about what "summer" means; bed resolution uses `is_bed_type`, so a TRELLIS is refused where `check_placement`'s looser `is_plant_parent_type` would accept it; and the within-plan rotation rule is genuinely new logic, because `CropRotationService.check_plant_placement` only compares against `records[0]` and succession entries never enter rotation history at all (the cross-year cooldown IS reused verbatim). `fits_window` deliberately reports "too slow" and "maturity unknown" alike, distinguishable via `days_to_maturity`; a too-slow candidate is returned ranked last, never dropped. No token, no `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-034/036 addenda, FR-AGENT-25, §8.19. |
| ✅ | D3.3 | **Calendar & task tools** ([#332](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/332)) — **Shipped v1.29.1 via PR #382.** unauthenticated read-only `get_tasks` / `get_task_calendar`, token-gated `add_manual_task` / `edit_manual_task` / `delete_manual_task`, and the `plan-my-week` prompt. **The whole seven-generator task engine becomes agent-reachable for the first time**, answering "what should I do this week?". Each task carries the generator's own fields plus the render-time `urgency` (from `classify_urgency`, never re-implemented) and the `status` from the shared store the Tasks tab reads. **Carries the D3 localisation decision**, stated once for both D3 stories: machine keys (`task_id`/`task_type`/`source`) are stable English; `title`/`notes` are display strings in the user's UI language. Three corrections to the issue's own spec implemented with it: `Task.source` has **six** values for seven generators (both soil generators emit `soil`, so `task_type` carries the distinction `source` cannot); `build_plan_state` needed a `today` parameter to make the answer reproducible at all, since only it called `date.today()`; and **agent task-status mutation is refused** — `set_task_status` is not a command, so exposing it would make it the one agent write a single Ctrl+Z cannot reverse. Generated tasks are refused by name on edit/delete (derived state, rebuilt every read). `source`/`status` hiding matches `tasks_view` exactly (`archived` + `dismissed`), so the agent is not a third surface disagreeing with the other two. No `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-034/036 addenda, FR-AGENT-27, §8.19. |
| ✅ | D3.4 | **Soil amendment tools** ([#333](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/333)) — **Shipped v1.29.1 via PR #382.** unauthenticated read-only `get_soil_status` / `recommend_amendments` / `get_soil_mismatches`, token-gated `record_soil_test`, and the `plan-soil-amendments` prompt. **Not a pure wrapper, and the issue said the wrong thing about localisation.** The issue attributed the problem to amendment *names*; those are bilingual *data* (`Amendment.name`/`name_de`) with a stable `id`, so the real gap was narrower and sharper: `get_mismatched_plants`' reason sentences were `translate`-only prose with **no machine key**. That is now one canonical `(reason_code, display_text)` builder with `get_mismatched_plants` as a projection, so both in-app callers are untouched. Three further corrections: the issue's `nitrogen`/`phosphorus`/`potassium` parameters are named `n_level`/`p_level`/`k_level` after the model (a name that states its scale is the cheapest guard), and the secondaries it omitted entirely are added because `_NUTRIENT_KINDS` reasons over all six; the ranges are **per-nutrient** (`k_level` is `1–4`, the kit has no K0; secondaries `0–2`), so one shared range check would be wrong; and **lab ppm is refused by name** because nothing in `services/` reads `*_ppm` and no conversion exists (US-12.10c), so a ppm-only record would report UNKNOWN health while looking complete. Also: `health_level` rates pH/N/P/K only and returns the **overall** rating for an unrecognised parameter, so a secondary reports `health_level: null` (no rating exists) rather than the bed's health mislabelled as calcium's; and `record_source` (`bed`/`global`/`none`) is reported because `get_effective_record` applies its hierarchy invisibly. No `FILE_VERSION` change. See ADR-034/036 addenda, FR-AGENT-28, §8.19. |

D3.3/D3.4 verification includes actual MCP-client calls against the production
provider graph and the frozen app. Review corrected soil response envelopes,
full-year/cross-year task generation, missing propagation, global-record
staleness, German amendment display names and numeric input coercion. See
§11.4.4. The complete write-enabled surface is 57 tools, 5 resources and
6 prompts. Owner approved release after plan/PR review and agent-driven live QA.
The preexisting German amendment-task naming gap is tracked in #408.

### Acceptance highlights (D2.0–D2.6)
- The writes-enabled toggle and bearer token are independent gates: write tools disappear when either is absent, and every call rechecks the token before the Qt hop. Reads remain open.
- Every agent document mutation uses the GUI's command path and remains undoable; `undo()`/`redo()` operate the same global LIFO stack one command at a time and refuse empty stacks.
- `create_object` builds through the loader, preserves the native Y-up frame, and refuses hostile or implausible geometry before Qt sees it; refusals leave the scene and undo stack unchanged.
- `get_geometry` is the stable low-level read: polygon/polyline points are mapped from the **live** Qt transform, curve/extent/radius data is curated rather than exposing serializer internals, and constraints are returned in deterministic order even though writes on those objects refuse.
- `set_object_position` derives a delta and enters the same move orchestration as `move_object`, including logical bed children and plant reparenting. Vertex writes share the GUI's canonical command builders; set/add/delete each add exactly one undo entry and restore the prior list.
- Same-scene save/load has one document-item cleanup predicate; `list_layers.object_count` agrees with the top-level `list_objects` roster, including callouts and Arc/Bezier items.
- Real MCP integration tests cover authentication, geometry frame agreement and no-op refusal, constrained refusals, concurrent delete behavior, global history, save/load, rendering, and adversarial callout offsets; the performance benchmark is reported as repeated medians rather than a single sample.

### Acceptance highlights (D1)
- Server is **on by default (read-only)**, binds **loopback only**, and shows the connect URL (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`); a Preferences toggle disables it and stops it cleanly. Getting that URL into each user's AI client is the D1.6 onboarding dialog.
- All Qt-touching work (scene snapshot, render, export, save) is **marshaled onto the main thread** from the server's asyncio thread; the `agent_api` core is otherwise Qt-free and unit-testable.
- Reads return the **curated agent schema** (stable, documented Pydantic models) by default; `raw=True` returns the serializer dict. No `FILE_VERSION` change.
- Objects are addressed by **stable UUID** (`item_id`); every list/query returns ids.
- `render_canvas_image` reuses `render_scene_region` (overlay-hiding / Y-flip / text-scaling already handled).
- **Integration test** boots the embedded server in-process and exercises tools end-to-end over an MCP client; **PyInstaller** build bundles `mcp` + `uvicorn`/`starlette`/`anyio` (hidden imports) and the exe smoke-test confirms the server starts.
- MCP **tool/resource/prompt descriptions are English** (an API contract for agents, not UI) — exempt from i18n; only the **Settings UI** strings go through `tr()`.

### Risks / open questions
- **PyInstaller bundling** of the MCP/uvicorn/starlette stack (hidden imports, `anyio` backends) — validate early in D1.1.
- Running an asyncio/uvicorn loop **alongside the Qt event loop** without blocking the UI — a background thread owns the loop; never call Qt from it directly.
- **Port conflicts** — configurable port + a clear error if the port is taken.
- **Loopback trust** — read tools remain open to local clients by design; all D2 scene-mutating tools are behind the writes-enabled setting and bearer token, with `undo`/`redo` covered by the same gate.

## Package F — Permaculture & Polyculture (📋 planned, epic: none)

> Filed from the permapeople.org research session (2026-08-17). Membership and
> order live in the `> Package map & order` blockquote at the head of each issue,
> which is the most current statement of the package's shape. **GitHub outranks
> this table.**
>
> | Status | US | Description |
> | ------ | -- | ----------- |
> | 📋 | **F1** ([#312](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/312)) | **Permaculture layer + plant function tags** — foundation of the package, **do first**. `PermacultureLayer` (7 food-forest layers + `UNKNOWN`) and `PlantFunction` (12 functions) as additive species attributes, ingested from Permapeople's currently-discarded `Layer`/`Uses`, filled for all 118 bundled records, editable in Plant Details, filterable in search/gallery, exposed in the curated agent schema. Plus an optional food-forest canvas-layer preset. New ADR + FR-PLANT-*. |
> | 📋 | **F2** ([#313](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/313)) | **Plant guilds** — guild templates, canvas membership, missing-role diagnostic. *Depends on F1*: guilds have nothing to reason on without layer/function tags. |
> | 📋 | **F3** ([#314](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/314)) | **Sun-requirement × computed hours-of-sun diagnostic** + canvas badge. *Independent*; its layer-stack section follows F1. Builds on the shipped Phase 14 sun/shade engine. |
> | 📋 | **F4** ([#315](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/315)) | **Plan timeline scrubber** — `removal_date` + plan-state-at-date visibility on the shared sim date. *Independent.* |
> | 📋 | **F5** ([#316](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/316)) | **Bundled example-plan gallery** + template export/import. **Last** — ideally after F2 and F4. Blocked on nothing technical, but #379 (retiring the hand-made dogfood fixture) waits on it. |

## Package G — Plant Data Quality & Attribution (🔶 3 of 4 shipped)

> Same research session as Package F. G1–G3 shipped in v1.28.1 (PR #368).

| Status | US | Description |
| ------ | -- | ----------- |
| ✅ | **G1** ([#311](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/311)) | **Licence + attribution** for all bundled data files, a "Data Sources & Licenses" section in About, and a licence line in Plant Details. Shipped v1.28.1 — closed the CC BY-SA compliance gap. **First in the package.** |
| ✅ | **G2** ([#317](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/317)) | **Plant profile header** — thumbnail, description, external links (Wikipedia/PFAF/POWO), off-thread fetch with disk caching. *Independent.* Shipped v1.28.1. |
| ✅ | **G3** ([#318](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/318)) | **Permapeople companions** — `get_companions()` with pagination, local cache, three-tier companion service (bundled → custom → provider). Shipped v1.28.1. New settings: `plants/download_images`, `plants/fetch_companion_data`. |
| 📋 | **G4** ([#320](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/320)) | **Plant favourites & named collections** — a Plant Lists panel with drag-to-canvas and JSON import/export (FR-8). *Independent.* The last open item in Package G. |

## Phase 14: 3D Visualization & Sun/Shade ✅ Complete (v1.24.5 – v1.24.12 — epic #255)

**Goal**: Full three-dimensional garden view with sun/shade simulation — the milestone that was planned to justify a major version bump.

> **Decision (2026-07-31): there is no v2.0 — the "v2.0 milestone" framing is retired.**
> US-E1…E9 all shipped and [epic #255](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/255)
> is closed, but every PR merged under the CI default (**patch**), so the milestone landed across
> **v1.24.5 – v1.24.12** and the line moved on to v1.26.2. Reviewed at completion and
> **deliberately not back-filled with a major bump**: the 3D view is not (yet) prominent enough
> in day-to-day use to carry a major-version claim. Versioning stays continuous and CI-driven;
> a future major bump, if there is one, will be earned by something else. Phase-14 scope
> exclusions previously labelled "v2.0" are labelled **Phase 14** throughout the docs.

- 3D visualization (engine decided by the US-E5 spike — **outcome: GO on PyQt6-3D**; PyVista rejected at +466 MB, pyqtgraph.opengl rejected for no directional-light/FPS-camera control. ADR-038)
- Object height properties (walls, fences, trees, structures)
- Sun path simulation (shade calculation by season, time-of-day animation, seasonal analysis)
- First-person walkthrough mode
- Plant growth over time visualization (seedling → mature)

**Planned 2026-07-19 — epic [#255](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/255).** Each US carries a full stand-alone implementation spec in its issue; the authoritative runbook is the `ogp-3d-sunshade-campaign` skill (load it plus `ogp-change-control` + `ogp-architecture-contract` before starting any US). Slice order is deliberately 2D-first: the sun/shade value (US-E1…E4) ships even if the 3D spike NO-GOs.

| Status | US    | Description                                                        | Issue | Depends on |
| ------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ---------- |
| ✅     | US-E1 | Solar position engine — Qt-free `core/solar.py` (NOAA/Meeus, math copied verbatim from the campaign oracle; pinned tests ±0.05° vs oracle + Meeus Example 25.a literature row + physical identities). See ADR-037, FR-SUN-01 | [#256](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/256) | — |
| ✅     | US-E2 | Object height property — additive `object_height_cm` + Qt-free `core/object_height.py` resolver (explicit → container fill → species `max_height_cm` → per-type default → None; type-matching by enum *name* keeps it Qt-free, name sets pinned against the enum) + undoable "Object height:" panel spin (effective value shown, 0 = Auto clears, `ChangePropertyCommand` apply_func — one undo step). No FILE_VERSION bump. See ADR-037, FR-SUN-02 | [#257](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/257) | — |
| ✅     | US-E3 | 2D analytic shadow overlay + sun date/time control — Qt-free `core/shadow_geometry.py` (`L = h/tan α`, MinkowskiSum sweep probed live + 8-step fallback, one integer-grid union), runtime-only `SunShadowOverlayItem` (z −500, odd-even fill, never serialized, survives `scene.clear()`), debounced recompute (scene.changed + stack_changed, snapshot-key echo guard), `SunSimToolbar` date/time-slider/animate control (local tz, sim time defaults to the current date/time each session), empty states (no-location hint / whole-canvas night shade), overlay clipped to the canvas bounds with a soft feathered edge. Binding pixel test pins the §8.19 render formula — no mirrored shadows. See ADR-037 addendum, FR-SUN-03/04, §8.20 | [#258](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/258) | E1, E2 |
| ✅     | US-E4 | Hours-of-sun heatmap — Qt-free `core/shade_aggregation.py` (15-min daylight sampling gated α>0 with shadow calls clamped ≥0.5°, bands <2/2–4/4–6/≥6 h, injected rasterizer) + `ui/canvas/sun_heatmap.py` (QImage rasterizer pinned vs point-in-polygon reference + 2-thread smoke test, `_WeatherFetchWorker`-shaped `HeatmapWorker`, runtime-only pixmap overlay z −450, full-sun transparent). Toy-case gates green on a real WALL scene (Dec 21 = 0 min, Jun 21 = 540±15); 60k-cell full-day compute ≪ 1 s (budget 2 s); recompute on demand only; date-change/sim-off clears; `closeEvent` joins the worker. "Hours of Sun" toolbar button + legend. **Redesigned by [#276](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/276):** the 4 discrete bands + the toolbar swatch legend are replaced by a smooth cool→warm ramp (alpha falls as sun-hours rise, `SmoothTransformation`) with labeled hourly topographic contour lines (even-hour `{n} h`) serving as the self-describing key — new Qt-free `core/heatmap_render.py` (numpy ramp LUT + vectorized marching squares + Chaikin smoothing); the aggregation/worker/toy-case gates are unchanged (display-only, no FILE_VERSION bump). See ADR-037 addendum, FR-SUN-05 | [#259](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/259) | E3 |
| ✅     | US-E5 | 3D engine spike — **GO: PyQt6-3D** (ADR-038, owner sign-off on the PR). Version-matched 6.11.0 wheel; the one trap: `PyQt6-3D-Qt6` must pin to `PyQt6-Qt6`'s micro (DLL "Prozedur nicht gefunden" otherwise). Decisive frozen-exe gate PASSED: `--spike-3d` in the packaged exe renders lit extruded boxes from a real `.ogp` (screenshot in ADR-038), dist +13 MB (limit +150). PyVista rejected (+466 MB), pyqtgraph.opengl rejected (no directional-light control / no FPS camera). Spike stayed dormant behind the flag (pinned never-imported-at-startup) until US-E6 removed it — the real 3D view supersedes it. §11.1 row closed | [#260](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/260) | E2 |
| ✅     | US-E6 | 3D view MVP — View → "3D View…": real prism extrusion of the US-E3 footprints × US-E2 heights (Qt-free `core/scene3d.py`: ear-clip triangulation + triangle soup + the pinned light gate (−0.2056, −0.4675, 0.8598) + sun∥shadow agreement invariant), flat decals for height-less items, orbit camera, sun light follows the sim time/location (night → dim overhead). One Qt3D import boundary (`ui/view3d/qt3d_adapter.py`); lazy load pinned by startup test; deps `PyQt6-3D==6.11.0`+`PyQt6-3D-Qt6==6.11.0` land in pyproject per ADR-038. Viewer-only MVP: manual Refresh, lighting-only (no engine shadow maps — stated). **Manual-test fix:** the viewer is recreated per open (a reused hidden→re-shown Qt3DWindow renders white — Qt3D never rebuilds its RHI swapchain), the previous window retired only once hidden/idle, and cleared on app-exit (else a parentless top-level blocks quit) — see §11.4. See ADR-038 addendum, FR-SUN-06 | [#261](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/261) | E5 GO |
| ✅     | US-E7 | First-person walkthrough — "Walk" toggle in the 3D View (engine `QFirstPersonCameraController`): WASD/arrows + hold-left-mouse look, fixed 165 cm eye height, plan-bounds clamp (+150 cm margin) via Qt-free `core/walk_camera.py` (pitch ±89° — no gimbal flip), Esc exits, orbit camera restored exactly (pinned). Sim-time light stays live while walking. Stated exclusions: no collision, flat ground, fixed eye height. **Manual-test fixes:** horizontal WASD+arrow movement (the engine's first-person controller free-flew along the pitched view vector — now a custom horizontal loop, `linearSpeed 0` look-only) and flat-decal layer-stacking in 3D (height-less items were ground-plane z-fighting — now lifted + stepped up the 2D order). See ADR-038 addendum, FR-SUN-07 | [#262](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/262) | E6 |
| ✅     | US-E8 | Growth-over-time visualization — Qt-free `core/growth_model.py` (linear **current→mature** over years-to-maturity: species `days_to_maturity` → else tree 10 y / 3 y / annual ≈season). **No new metadata** — reuses the existing `plant_instance` fields (`planting_date`, `current_height_cm`, `current_spread_cm`). Resolver `at_date` param routes measured+dated plants through the model; independently of any date the measured `current_height_cm` now outranks the species max (new `SOURCE_CURRENT` tooltip), and `collect_shadow_casters` mirrors it for the canopy — shadow overlay, heatmap and 3D all pass the sim date, so scrub +5 y and the garden regrows everywhere from one model. New plants get today's `planting_date` stamped at creation (fresh-creation sites only — never on load). Stored geometry never mutated (byte-identical-save pin, #218/#219 scars). **Redesigned after owner manual test**: the first cut interpolated the *species* min→max keyed on the planting date alone — nothing set that date at creation, so every plant fell through to the mature max ("shadow scales only based on max height") while the Plant Details Current height/spread fields drove nothing at all. See ADR-037 growth addendum (redesign note), FR-SUN-08 | [#263](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/263) | E6 |
| ✅     | US-E9 | *(Optional)* Asset-forge dev tooling — `ogp-asset-forge` skill (house-style contract derived from the shipped set, generation methods with procedural preferred, provenance discipline: no PROVENANCE.md entry → no merge), mechanical tileability gate (`scripts/check_texture_tileability.py`, seam vs 98th-percentile internal-step metric, threshold 1.6, pinned by test incl. a legacy-seam list that may only shrink — audit found real seams in `flagstone.png`/`glass.png`), and two pilot textures generated procedurally (`decking`, `corten` — deterministic seed, wrap-stamped primitives + wrap-blur, `scripts/generate_asset_forge_textures.py`) wired through `FillPattern` + i18n. No runtime/network dependency; external game-assets skill stays rejected | [#264](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/264) | — (off critical path) |

Reserved identifiers: **ADR-037** (solar + shadow architecture), **ADR-038** (3D engine choice), **§8.20**, **FR-SUN-\***. `FILE_VERSION` stays `"1.4"` (heights/planted-date are additive metadata).

## Phase 15 — Visual Refresh (epic thread: #279 → #281)

The app's visuals grew ad-hoc while functionality matured; Phase 15 modernizes them in packages. Decisions locked in the 2026-07-25 planning session: line+accent icon style, theme-tinted at runtime; icons + chrome in one package; plant art completely redesigned as its own package.

| Status | Package | Description | Issue | Shipped |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| ✅ | 1 | **Themed iconography + modernized chrome** — 72-icon line set (62 Tabler v3.45.0 vendored MIT + 10 bespoke) on the 24×24 `currentColor`+accent-sentinel contract, rendered only via the runtime-tinting provider `ui/icons.py`; all 5 legacy load paths + ~28 menu actions migrated, `icons/tools/` deleted; normalize/conformance/provenance gates. Chrome: `ui/theme.py` as the single home of chrome colors (semantic tokens, shared `URGENCY_TOKENS`, typography/color/button roles as dynamic properties, live-switch propagation, saturated banners by design), theme-blind surfaces fixed (dark-mode weather cards, popups off the OS palette), QSS-color lint gate (empty allowlist). ADR-039 (+ review addendum), FR-28, §8.4/§8.21, §5.7, two §11.4 pitfalls. Two senior-review rounds. | [#279](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/279) | ✅ v1.25.0 (PR [#280](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/280)) |
| ✅ | 2 | **Plant illustration redesign ("Lush Sprite")** — all 123 SVGs generated by `scripts/generate_plant_sprites.py` (13 seeded archetype builders + recipe tables; generator = provenance; byte-determinism gate makes hand edits unlandable). Top-down radial shading, per-leaf gradients + occlusion, dome foreshortening for ball canopies, conifer branch-whorls, clumped grass/fern tufts (two owner manual-test rounds). Gates: QtSvg-subset allowlist walk, element/byte budgets, and the **visual-weight metric** (ink-coverage [0.30, 0.75], spread ≤ 2.0×, 16 px floor) — palette conformance is enforced transitively via byte-determinism (most colors are mix/lighten-derived, so a literal-set check is not implementable). Bonus: `hedge.png` regenerated in the same leaf language (HEDGE_POLYGON fills with the texture, not the sprite), tileability-gated. Four senior-review rounds. ADR-040, §8.22, FR-29. | [#281](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/281) | v1.26.0 (PR #282) |
| ✅ | 3 | **Scoped 2026-08-17** (decision log on the epic; ADR-042, FR-30) into three sequential PRs — `minor` label on whichever merges last (v1.27.0). **3a — generated object sprites** ([#308](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/308)): all 15 furniture/infrastructure SVGs regenerated by `scripts/generate_object_sprites.py` in the "Lush Object" style (full parity with the plant sprites, no baked shadow, viewBox = footprint, `--check` determinism + allowlist/budget/visual-weight gates), roster grown by 9 types (sandbox, trampoline, hot tub, swing, picnic table, hammock, wheelbarrow, pergola, bird bath), aspect-preserving gallery thumbnails, square BBQ art, forward-compat pin (no FILE_VERSION bump). **3b — textures** ([#309](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/309)): all 24 textures regenerated by `scripts/generate_asset_forge_textures.py` — a numpy float64 torus painter (analytic AA primitives, radial shading, occlusion halos, periodic noise, torus Voronoi, in-repo wrap blur), Lush everywhere, pixel-exact `--check` (bytes are a zlib property — §11.4), tint-band + on-canvas seam gates (both axes), the `KNOWN_SEAMED_LEGACY` grandfather list emptied and deleted, legacy Qt generator deleted. **3c — iconography** ([#310](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/310)): status bar, tabs + frost badge, Plants/Garden + all File/Edit/View residue, layers_panel migration, `lawn.svg`, code→file gate, all emoji pseudo-icons, View menu regrouped into submenus, Tasks/Harvest → Ctrl+4/5. | [#284](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/284) | 3a: ✅ [PR #322](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/322) → v1.26.8 · 3b: ✅ [PR #323](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/323) → v1.26.9 · 3c: ✅ [PR #325](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/325) → **v1.27.0** (all 2026-08-18; #324 was the original 3c PR, auto-closed when its stacked base merged) |

> **Decision (2026-07-19):** the external `claude-skill-game-assets-enhancer` skill was evaluated for 3D asset generation and rejected — it produces 2D game sprites via a paid fal.ai API, no 3D assets; Phase 14's 3D pipeline is procedural (extruded footprints). The salvageable idea (AI-generated textures through the existing `fill_patterns.py` seam, already sanctioned by §11.1) is captured as optional US-E9. Full rationale in epic #255.

## Phase 16: Platform & Community (Future)

**Goal**: Extend the platform with community features, plugins, and cross-platform support.

- Plugin system for extensibility
- Community template sharing / marketplace
- Irrigation planning & drip system design
- Cost estimation & budget tracking (advanced)
- Cross-platform packaging (macOS, Linux)

## Phase 17: Living Garden 3D (epic [#383](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/383)) — L0 complete (GO)

**Goal**: make the 3D mode the reason to open the app — *Lush Cinematic* look, experience + analyze (editing stays in 2D, 3D only selects), 100 % procedural models, and **truth before beauty** (heights, spreads, sun, shadows, date and north gated against the data). Owner decisions 2026-10-03. Renderer: Qt Quick 3D replacing the deprecated Qt 3D, decided by the ADR-048 GO/NO-GO spike. Every 3D-visible change goes `ogp-3d-creator` → `ogp-3d-reviewer` → `senior-reviewer` (skills `ogp-lush-cinematic`, `ogp-3d-renderer`).

| Status | Package | Description | Issue |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- | ----- |
| ✅ | L0 | **Proof of Beauty** — ADR-048 criteria committed before measuring; deterministic bench plans; dormant `--spike-q3d` renderer with sky, soft shadows, procedural trees/plants/roofs/fences; measurements M1–M12 in the container and the frozen Windows exe; Beauty Board; agents + skills. **GO 2026-10-05 (owner GPU run in ADR-048 entry 19); evidence tooling deleted.** | [#384](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/384) |
| 📋 | L1 | **New engine, new light** — sim clock, scene contract v2, engine package, Plan/3D/Split workspace without camera resets, sky + presets, ground bake, built world v0, plant v0, selection sync + walk collision, default flip, Qt 3D removal | [#385](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/385) |
| 📋 | L2 | **Analyze in 3D** — shadow and sun-hours drapes, sun path + day sweep, info card + growth jump, cutaway | [#386](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/386) |
| 📋 | L3 | **Plant Forge** — procedural species models from the sprite recipes, LODs, phenology | [#387](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/387) |

## Task-date correctness + audit P1 cluster — **shipped v1.29.5** (PR [#419](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/pull/419))

Not a phase — a hardening package, shipped on `master` alongside v1.29.4. Six
issues from two sources: three correctness bugs found by the ADR-048 L0 senior
reviews, and three effort-S items from the [2026-10 repository audit](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/392)
(both audit P0s were already closed by #411/#412; this takes the remaining S
items that are disjoint in file terms).

| # | Title | Sev | Effort | Origin | Outcome |
|---|-------|-----|--------|--------|---------|
| [#414](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/414) | Task calendar: GUI surfaces miss every frost-relative window anchored on another year's frost (TD-037) | P1 | M | ADR-048 L0 senior review | Every GUI surface routes through one shared multi-anchor entry point |
| [#415](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/415) | Planting calendar: the propagation editor saves steps in the wrong year | bug | S | ADR-048 L0 senior review | Editor shows real dates; inverted overrides ignored, never destroyed |
| [#416](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/416) | Plant data: harvest offsets are read two ways | bug | S | ADR-048 L0 senior review | Documentation made true; row conversion split out to [#418](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/418) |

### What changed, in one paragraph

The Tasks tab, the planting-calendar dashboard and the Gantt each anchored their
frost-relative task windows on **the current year's** last spring frost, while the
agent's `get_tasks` / `get_task_calendar` anchored on every year that could reach
the requested date. Measured over the 64 bundled species that carry calendar offsets x 6 frost dates x every 10th day of 2026 (222 cases):
**1,849 (task, frost-date, day) cases the GUI missed and the agent listed;
0 after the fix**, with 0 surplus tasks (the urgency filter still applies). Harness committed as `scripts/measure_task_window_sweep.py`. A
southern plan (20 September frost) put a tomato harvest at 29 Nov 2026 – 7 Feb
2027, so on 1 January 2027 a tomato-only plan read *"No tasks — you're all caught
up."* while the task was open. See ADR-029 (addendum) and ADR-049.

### Deliberately deferred

- **[#418](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/issues/418)** — converting
  the bundled harvest offsets to their true reading. Measured: both readings fit a majority of the 64 comparable rows (38 frost-relative, 45 planting-relative), with 11 fitting neither, so the data is NOT irreconcilable; it needs a cited
  horticultural source per row. **Garlic's harvest window lands ~3 months LATE** (October, not July) until then - and that is independent of which reading you assume, since its row fits the frost-relative one on maturity.
- **#399** (branch protection / `--admin`), **#401** (mypy gate), **#402**
  (coverage gate), **#405** (logging policy), **#409** (NFR-PERF-01), **#406**
  (constraint-tool coverage) — all still open; #401/#402 deliberately measure their
  baselines against this package's settled tree rather than inside it.
