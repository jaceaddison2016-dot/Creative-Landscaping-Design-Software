# Open Garden Planner

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cofade/open-garden-planner?label=Latest%20Release)](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/releases/latest)
[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**Precision garden planning for passionate gardeners who value independence and transparency.**

Open Garden Planner is an open-source desktop application that combines CAD-like metric accuracy with garden-specific features. Plan your garden with centimeter precision, track plants with rich metadata, and export to standard formats - all without subscription fees or vendor lock-in.

## Why Open Garden Planner?

Existing tools are either:
- **Expensive commercial software** with subscription fees and proprietary formats
- **Visual-only planners** that lack metric precision
- **General CAD tools** that require steep learning curves and lack garden features

Open Garden Planner fills the gap: **engineering-grade precision meets gardener-friendly workflows**.

## Features

- **Metric Accuracy**: Plan with centimeter-level precision on a calibrated canvas
- **Image Calibration**: Import satellite imagery and calibrate to real-world scale
- **Rich Plant Metadata**: Track species, varieties, planting dates, and growing requirements
- **Online Plant Database**: Search Trefle.io, Perenual, and Permapeople for plant data
- **Object Library**: Property structures, garden beds, containers, trellises, plants, paths, fences
- **CAD Precision Tools**: Relative/polar coordinate input, snapping (midpoint, intersection, tangent, perpendicular), Bezier/arc drawing, fillet/chamfer
- **Smart Symbols**: Reusable parametric blocks (raised beds, pergolas, greenhouses) that regenerate on parameter edit
- **Layers**: Organize objects into manageable layers with visibility/lock controls
- **Standard Formats**: JSON project files (.ogp), PNG/SVG/PDF/DXF export, CSV plant lists
- **Garden Smart Features**: Harvest tracking, task management & reminders, succession planting, soil health tracking
- **AI Agent Integration**: Embedded MCP server exposes the live plan for reading, visualization, export, and optional token-gated editing (including stable low-level geometry)
- **Modern UI**: Clean interface with light and dark modes, keyboard shortcuts
- **Auto-Save**: Periodic auto-save with crash recovery

## Installation

### Windows Installer (recommended)

Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/releases) page:

> **[Download Latest Installer](https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner/releases/latest)**

Run the installer and follow the wizard. It will:
- Install to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Open Garden Planner` (configurable)
- Create Start Menu and optional desktop shortcuts
- Optionally associate `.ogp` files so you can double-click to open them
- Register in Add/Remove Programs for clean uninstallation

**System requirements:** Windows 10+ (64-bit), 4 GB RAM, 200 MB disk space.

#### Verify your download

Each release includes a `SHA256SUMS.txt` file. To verify the installer integrity:

```powershell
# PowerShell — replace <version> with the actual version you downloaded
(Get-FileHash .\OpenGardenPlanner-<version>-Setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
```

Compare the output with the hash in `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the release page.

From the next release onward, every release also carries a **build
provenance attestation** — a cryptographic, GitHub-native proof (no paid
certificate involved) that a release artifact was built by this project's
public CI from a specific, inspectable commit of the public source, not
tampered with or built anywhere else. Verify it with the
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```bash
gh attestation verify OpenGardenPlanner-<version>-Setup.exe -R cofade/open-garden-planner --signer-workflow cofade/open-garden-planner/.github/workflows/release.yml
```

The same command works against the **installed app exe** too — `C:\Program Files (x86)\Open Garden Planner\OpenGardenPlanner.exe` — which is the exact file Windows Defender has been reported flagging (issue #356); it is attested separately from the installer, not just implied by it. `--signer-workflow` pins the check to *this repo's own* release workflow, not merely "any workflow in this repository" (the plain `-R` form is still valid, just slightly less specific).

**Why Windows may warn anyway:** the installer is not Authenticode-signed
(see `docs/11-risks-and-technical-debt` §11.1/§11.2) — that costs a paid
certificate this free/open-source project doesn't currently budget for. An
unsigned, low-download-volume executable is exactly the profile Windows
SmartScreen, Defender's ML heuristics (e.g. `Wacatac.B/C!ml`), and Norton's
file-reputation engine (e.g. `FileRepMalware[Misc]`, issue #358) are prone to
flag, which is a known false-positive pattern for PyInstaller-built apps in
general, not something specific to this project. That's a real warning worth
taking seriously, not something to click through blindly — verify the
checksum and/or the attestation above first. If you've verified the file and
still see a warning, please also report it as a false positive:
[Microsoft's file submission](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission)
(or the [URL submission form](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/AppRepSubmission)
for the release link) for Defender/SmartScreen, or the
[Norton false-positive portal](https://submissions.norton.com/reportfalsepositive)
(File tab) for Norton — every report helps the app build reputation faster.

### Install from source

Requires Python 3.11+ and Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner.git
cd open-garden-planner
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install -e .
python -m open_garden_planner
```

### Build the installer yourself

If you prefer to build the installer from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cofade/open-garden-planner.git
cd open-garden-planner
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
pip install pyinstaller

# Build PyInstaller bundle + NSIS installer (requires NSIS: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/)
python installer/build_installer.py
```

The installer will be created in the `dist\` directory.

### Plant Database (optional)

To enable online plant search, see the [Plant API Setup Guide](docs/03-context-and-scope/PLANT_API_SETUP.md).

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+** with **PyQt6** for desktop UI
- **QGraphicsView** for hardware-accelerated 2D canvas
- **Trefle.io / Perenual / Permapeople** APIs for plant species data
- **pytest + pytest-qt** for testing

## Status

**Core 2D, 3D, and visual-refresh phases shipped** — CAD precision tooling and garden
smart features are complete; the embedded AI Agent Integration's read/export and
token-gated D1/D2 tool surfaces are live, with D3 domain intelligence next. See the
[Development Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for the authoritative, up-to-date phase/user-story
table and current version.
