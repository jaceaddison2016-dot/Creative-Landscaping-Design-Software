# 8. Crosscutting Concepts

## 8.1 Coordinate System

**Origin**: Bottom-left corner of canvas (CAD convention)
**Y-axis**: Increases upward (mathematical/CAD convention, not screen coordinates)
**Units**: Centimeters internally, displayed as cm or m based on context

```python
@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float  # centimeters, positive = East/Right
    y: float  # centimeters, positive = North/Up (CAD convention)
    z: float = 0.0  # centimeters, elevation (unused in 2D, ready for 3D)
```

Qt's QGraphicsView uses Y-down screen coordinates. The canvas view applies a transform to flip the Y-axis for display while maintaining the CAD convention in the data model.

## 8.2 Command Pattern (Undo/Redo)

All modifications to the document are wrapped in command objects:

```python
class Command(ABC):
    def execute(self) -> None: ...
    def undo(self) -> None: ...

class MoveObjectCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, obj: GardenObject, old_pos: Point, new_pos: Point): ...
```

- Every user action that modifies state creates a Command
- Commands are pushed onto an UndoStack (QUndoStack)
- Undo history clears on project close (standard behavior)
- Each vertex operation, property change, etc. is a separate undoable command
- The `CommandManager` is owned by `CanvasView` and shared with `CanvasScene` via `scene.get_command_manager()` so that `QGraphicsItem` subclasses can push commands directly when handling resize, rotation, or vertex-editing interactions
- Operations that change both geometry and position (e.g. scaling from a left handle) must be captured in a single command to avoid requiring multiple undos
- An **Arrange** gesture (Bring to Front/Forward, Send Backward/to Back — issue #338, ADR-043, §8.25) is one `ArrangeItemsCommand`, however many layers or block members it touches; a gesture that changes nothing (already at front/back, no overlapping object to step past) pushes **nothing** onto the undo stack — the seam reports the reason instead (`ui/canvas/arrange.py::build_arrange_command`).

## 8.3 Internationalization (i18n)

Uses Qt Linguist translation system:

1. All user-facing strings wrapped in `self.tr()` or `QCoreApplication.translate()`
2. Source strings extracted with `pylupdate6` into `.ts` XML files
3. Translators edit `.ts` files (Qt Linguist tool or text editor)
4. `.ts` files compiled to `.qm` binary with `lrelease`
5. `QTranslator` loaded at app startup based on saved language preference

**Shipped languages**: English (default), German
**Extensible**: Community can add languages by creating new `.ts` files

**Translation files location**:
- `src/open_garden_planner/resources/translations/open_garden_planner_de.ts`
- `src/open_garden_planner/resources/translations/open_garden_planner_en.ts`

**Not translated**: Plant scientific names (Latin), file format identifiers

### How to add translations when creating/modifying a widget

1. **In code**: wrap every UI string with `self.tr("English text")`. The class name is the translation context automatically.

2. **Update both `.ts` files** — add a `<context>` block (or extend an existing one) to both files:

   ```xml
   <context>
       <name>MyWidget</name>
       <message>
           <source>English text</source>
           <translation>Translated text</translation>
       </message>
   </context>
   ```

   Note: German file uses `<name>` with no extra indent, English file uses 4-space indent.

3. **Recompile `.qm` files** after every `.ts` change:
   ```bash
   venv/Lib/site-packages/qt6_applications/Qt/bin/lrelease.exe \
     src/open_garden_planner/resources/translations/open_garden_planner_de.ts \
     src/open_garden_planner/resources/translations/open_garden_planner_en.ts
   ```

### Translation rules

- **Always use `self.tr("string")`** for every user-visible string in any `QWidget` subclass.
- Strings passed to `CollapsiblePanel(title, ...)` must use `self.tr("title")` at the **call site** (e.g. in `application.py`), because `CollapsiblePanel` is generic and has no context for the title string.
- `QT_TR_NOOP("string")` marks strings for extraction without translating them at that point (used in module-level dicts). Translate them later with `QCoreApplication.translate("ContextClass", string)`.
- Non-`QObject` contexts (e.g. module-level code) use `QCoreApplication.translate("ContextName", "string")`.

### Context menu strings in QGraphicsItem subclasses

`QGraphicsItem` subclasses (e.g. `CircleItem`, `PolygonItem`, `BackgroundImageItem`) are **not** `QObject` subclasses, so `self.tr()` is unavailable or incorrect. Use the shorthand alias at the top of every `contextMenuEvent()`:

```python
def contextMenuEvent(self, event):
    _ = QCoreApplication.translate
    action = menu.addAction(_("ClassName", "String"))
```

**Dynamic toggle labels** (e.g. "Lock Image" / "Unlock Image") must call `QCoreApplication.translate` on **both branches individually** so `pylupdate6` can extract both source strings:

```python
# CORRECT — both strings are extractable by pylupdate6
lock_text = (
    _("BackgroundImageItem", "Unlock Image")
    if self._locked
    else _("BackgroundImageItem", "Lock Image")
)

# WRONG — only one branch is extracted
lock_text = _("BackgroundImageItem", "Unlock Image" if self._locked else "Lock Image")
```

This pattern was systematically applied across all item classes in issues #148/#149.

## 8.4 Theme System

**Single source of truth: [`ui/theme.py`](../../src/open_garden_planner/ui/theme.py)** (ADR-039). Two complete palettes (`ThemeColors.LIGHT`/`DARK`, key parity pinned by `tests/unit/test_theme.py`) feed one generated application stylesheet (`generate_stylesheet`); the preference (light/dark/system) persists in QSettings and applies live via `apply_theme()` — no restart.

### 8.4.1 Color tokens & the no-hex rule

Base/surface/text/border/accent/status tokens plus the #279 semantic additions: `success_bg`/`warning_bg`/`error_bg`/`info_bg` (tinted banner/card surfaces), `caution` ("this week" urgency yellow), and the `overlay_*` family (dynamic-input overlay — deliberately **constant across modes** because it floats over the always-light canvas). Canvas colors are identical in both modes by design (the garden always renders bright; pinned by `test_default_canvas_color`).

**The no-hex rule**: widget code never hardcodes a chrome color. Styling comes either from the generated stylesheet (via the dynamic properties below) or from the live-palette helpers `theme_color()` / `theme_qcolor()` / `rgba(token, alpha)`. Enforced mechanically by `tests/unit/test_no_hardcoded_qss_colors.py` — the allowlist is EMPTY and stays that way without an ADR-039-documented reason.

### 8.4.2 Typography & widget roles (dynamic properties)

Styled centrally in the generated stylesheet, assigned via `theme.set_text_role(widget, role, color_role)` (which re-polishes, so post-polish changes apply — the §8.17.6 gotcha):

- `QLabel[textRole="h1"/"h2"/"hint"/"small"/"placeholder"]` — size/weight/style
- `QLabel[colorRole="success"/"warning"/"error"/"info"/"caution"/"disabled"/"secondary"]` — semantic text color (orthogonal to textRole; combinable)
- `QPushButton[buttonRole="primary"/"secondary"]` — accent-branded dialog CTAs (welcome dialog)
- `QLineEdit[inputError="true"]`, `QFrame[weatherCard="true"][frostSeverity="orange"/"red"]`
- objectName rules: `#TaskReminderBar` (warning_bg banner), `#UpdateBar` (info_bg), `#constraintsDeleteAllBtn`

> **Do not rename an objectName purely for styling.** For any widget the main window persists — every `QToolBar` — the objectName is also `QMainWindow.saveState()`'s persistence key, so renaming it silently resets that widget's saved layout for every existing user. Add a new selector instead. See §11.4 (#283).

Weight uses `font-weight: 600` (support pinned by `test_theme_tokens.py`; documented fallback is `bold`).

### 8.4.3 Theme propagation contract

`apply_theme()` publishes the resolved palette FIRST (`current_colors()` / `is_dark_theme()` read it live), notifies `register_theme_listener` subscribers (the icon provider clears its cache), restyles via `app.setStyleSheet`, then walks `allWidgets()` duck-typed: widgets exposing `apply_theme_colors(colors)` get palette-driven redraws (CanvasView, dashboards — typically a debounced `schedule_refresh()`); widgets exposing `refresh_theme_icons()` re-request their icons (the three toolbars, the main window's tracked menu actions). New widgets opt in by defining one of the two hooks — no registration list.

### 8.4.4 QSS capability limits

No box-shadow, no transitions, no outline focus rings — focus is a 2 px border swap with 1 px padding compensation (no layout jump). Tabs are underline-style (documentMode: style `QTabBar::tab` directly, `::pane` is partially ignored). Outer popup frames (QMenu/QToolTip) stay square on Windows (rounded corners artifact); only inner menu-item pills get radii.

## 8.5 Graphics Asset Pipeline

### UI icons (chrome — `resources/icons/ui/`, ADR-039)
- Line-icon set on a mechanical contract (24×24, `currentColor` + accent sentinel `#3D8B37`): 150 Tabler-vendored (MIT, pinned release) + 12 bespoke glyphs (#279 + #310)
- Tinted at runtime by the central provider `ui/icons.py` — never fed to QSvgRenderer directly (see §8.21)
- Gates: `scripts/normalize_icons.py` (idempotent canonicalizer) + `scripts/check_icon_conformance.py` + per-icon PROVENANCE — no entry, no merge

### Plant SVGs (`resources/plants/`, ADR-040)
- **Generated, never hand-edited**: all 108 species + 15 category sprites are emitted by `scripts/generate_plant_sprites.py` in the user-approved "Lush Sprite" style; committed files must byte-match regeneration (`--check` + determinism test). See §8.22.
- Top-down, rotation-safe radial shading; QtSvg-subset only; contract in `resources/plants/README.md`, provenance in `resources/plants/PROVENANCE.md`
- Consumed unchanged by `core/plant_renderer.py` (cached pixmaps, stable per-item rotation, optional tint)

### Textures (`resources/textures/`, ADR-042 / #309)
- **Generated, never hand-edited**: all 24 fill-pattern textures (grass, gravel, concrete, wood, water, soil, mulch, roof tiles, sand, stone, glass, hedge, brick, bark, wildflower, terracotta, pebbles, slate, lattice, compost, flagstone, clay, decking, corten) are emitted by `scripts/generate_asset_forge_textures.py` in the "Lush" texture language; committed PNGs must be pixel-identical to regeneration (`--check` + `tests/unit/test_texture_forge_conformance.py`). See §8.24.
- 256×256 px RGB, **1 px = 1 cm** on the canvas (no LOD variants — Qt scales the brush); strictly top-down, no directional light; seamless by construction on a torus, gated by `scripts/check_texture_tileability.py` for every file
- Loaded as `QPixmap` by `core/fill_patterns.py`, tinted with the user's fill colour at 80/255 alpha (`_tint_texture`) and applied via `QBrush` texture pattern; the tint-readability band is gated
- Provenance: `resources/textures/PROVENANCE.md` (generator = provenance, one register row per file)

### Object SVGs (`resources/objects/`, ADR-042 / #308)
- **Generated, never hand-edited**: all 24 furniture + infrastructure sprites are emitted by `scripts/generate_object_sprites.py` in the "Lush Object" style (the man-made sibling of the plant art); committed files must byte-match regeneration (`--check` + determinism test). See §8.23.
- Top-down, light from straight above, **no baked shadow** (the item-level painted shadow is the single source — furniture rotation is user-controlled); QtSvg-subset only; viewBox = nominal footprint in cm (gate-read table); contract in `resources/objects/README.md`, provenance in `resources/objects/PROVENANCE.md`
- Consumed unchanged by `core/furniture_renderer.py` (cached pixmaps, stretched to the item rect); gallery thumbnails letterbox by viewBox aspect

## 8.6 Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process

1. **Create feature branch**: `feature/US-X.X-short-description`
2. **Read user story** from roadmap
3. **Implement** with type hints
4. **Write tests**, run lint (`pytest tests/ -v && ruff check src/`)
5. **Write integration test** — see section 8.10; mandatory, no exceptions
6. **Manual testing** by user
7. **Commit** after approval: `feat(US-X.X): Description`
8. **Push and create PR** via GitHub CLI
9. **Merge with admin flag** (squash merge)
10. **Switch back to master**: `git checkout master && git pull`

### Code Quality Standards

- **Type hints**: All functions must have type annotations
- **Linting**: Code must pass ruff checks
- **Test coverage**: New code must maintain >80% coverage
- **Line length**: 110 characters (Black/ruff config)

### Git Workflow

- **master branch**: Always deployable, protected
- **Feature branches**: `feature/US-X.X-short-description`
- **Commits**: Small, atomic, conventional commit format
- **PRs**: Required for all changes, must pass CI

## 8.7 Error Handling

- **Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable**: external services (Google Maps, Trefle, Perenual, Permapeople) degrade quietly without blocking application workflow.
- **Two-phase atomic project loading (AUD-040, TD-017, #403)**:
  `ProjectManager.load()` deserializes and validates all items, layers, guides, and constraints in memory (Phase 1) before mutating or clearing the active `CanvasScene` (Phase 2). If Phase 1 raises, the current scene remains 100% intact. On any failure, `_current_file` is cleared (`None`), the document is marked dirty, and `_load_project_file` preserves any existing autosave file on disk, guaranteeing that subsequent Save/Ctrl+S actions cannot overwrite the previous plan file with empty or partial content.
- **Missing or corrupt assets load as placeholders (AUD-043, TD-011, #397)**:
  Background images with missing disk paths or invalid embedded image bytes load as non-rendering `BackgroundImageItem` placeholders (`is_placeholder=True`). On subsequent saves, the placeholder re-emits its original raw dictionary so external asset links survive across sessions instead of being silently deleted.
- **Duplicate item UUID detection & re-minting (AUD-043, TD-011, #397)**:
  If a corrupted or hand-edited `.ogp` file contains duplicate `item_id` values, the loader detects the collision, logs a warning, and re-mints a fresh UUID for colliding items, preserving scene graph integrity and unambiguous agent addressing.
- **Undecodable item accounting**:
  Malformed or unknown items in `.ogp` files are skipped with a logged warning, and the skipped count is tracked in `ProjectManager.last_load_skipped_items_count` for diagnostics reporting.
- **Auto-save recovery on crash**:
  Periodic autosaves write to `~autosave_...` next to the project file (or in temp for untitled plans). Autosaves are cleared only after a new file load succeeds.
- **No silent failures**: all errors logged and shown to user where appropriate.

## 8.8 Settings Storage — One Chokepoint (ADR-041)

User state lives in a platform-native QSettings store (Windows: registry under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\cofade\Open Garden Planner`; Linux:
`~/.config/cofade/Open Garden Planner.conf`; macOS: a plist), split across two
wrappers over **one** backend:

| Wrapper | Owns | Keys |
|---------|------|------|
| `app/settings.py` — `AppSettings` | user preferences: recent files, theme, language, auto-save interval, snap toggles, frost thresholds, Agent API port/token/write-toggle, API keys, last-used fillet/chamfer values | flat, grouped by domain (`canvas/`, `appearance/`, `agent_api/`, …) |
| `app/ui_state.py` — `UiStateStore` | UI-only state: window geometry, `QMainWindow` state (toolbar layout), main splitter sizes | `UiState/` |

Per-panel collapse/expand state is deliberately **not** persisted — the sidebar
accordion starts fully collapsed every session (US-226, ADR-030, §8.17.7).

**The rule: `app/settings.create_qsettings()` is the only place in the repo that
may construct — or even name — `QSettings`.** Everything that persists state
takes its backend from that factory. Enforced by an AST walk over `src/`,
`tests/` and `scripts/` in `tests/unit/test_settings_chokepoint.py` (three test
modules are exempt with stated reasons; `tests/` is in scope because the #283
damage was observed from the test side, and `scripts/` because a dev script runs
outside pytest where nothing isolates it — `installer/` is not scanned only
because it has never touched settings), not by convention: `UiStateStore` built
its own store until #285, which meant it escaped the test isolation layered on
`AppSettings`, and every full-app test read *and overwrote* the developer's real
window geometry and toolbar layout — 120 measured writes from a single test file
(§11.4, ADR-041).

**This section is the single specification of the mechanism.** ADR-041 records the
decision and the alternatives; §11.4 and `CLAUDE.md` record the incident. Neither
restates how it works, because three earlier attempts to keep a second copy in
sync each drifted within one commit. Change the mechanism, change it here.

Three further rules, each gated, each worth understanding before touching this:

- The factory reads `ORGANIZATION_NAME` / `APPLICATION_NAME` from module globals
  **on every call**, never captured at import. That is what lets the test suite
  redirect every consumer at once, which `tests/conftest.py` does at its own
  **import time** (module scope, not in a fixture — pytest imports the root
  conftest before any test module, so even a store built during an import lands
  in the test key; a fixture runs after collection and could not). Do not
  "optimise" the names into a default argument, a module-level tuple or a
  `functools.partial` — `test_rebinding_the_names_redirects_new_stores` will stop
  you, and neither can they retarget an *existing* store (ADR-041).
- **Prefer building a store at runtime over import time.** A module-level
  `_STORE = create_qsettings()` (or one in a class body, decorator or default
  argument) can be redirected by nothing at all once constructed.
  `TestNoStoreIsBuiltAtImportTime` flags it; since the conftest redirection this
  is belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing, and it reads names, so one level
  of indirection defeats it.
- **Never call `QSettings.setDefaultFormat()` or `QSettings.setPath()`** to set
  anything up — not in `src/`, not in a test (both gated). They are process-global
  statics Qt never reverts; a leaked `setPath` to a deleted `tmp_path` once
  poisoned every store built later in the session and broke six unrelated tests
  (§11.4). Redirect the factory instead. The single sanctioned call is
  `isolate_qsettings`'s teardown, which restores the captured `defaultFormat()`
  and then asserts it had not changed — a tripwire, not a silent repair.

## 8.9 QGraphicsView Overlay Widget Patterns

These rules apply whenever you add a **fixed overlay widget** on top of the canvas (minimap, toolbox, legend, etc.).

### 8.9.1 Widget parenting — always parent to the QGraphicsView, never to its viewport

```python
# WRONG — viewport children scroll with scene content
super().__init__(canvas_view.viewport())

# CORRECT — QGraphicsView (QAbstractScrollArea) children stay fixed
super().__init__(canvas_view)
```

`QGraphicsView.scrollContentsBy()` calls `viewport()->scroll()`, which physically moves every child widget of the viewport. Child widgets of the **QGraphicsView itself** are unaffected.

### 8.9.2 Defer initial positioning with QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)

At construction time the widget has not been shown or laid out, so `viewport().geometry()` may return a zero-size rect. Defer the first `_reposition()` call:

```python
QTimer.singleShot(0, self._reposition)   # fires after event loop iteration
```

Continue repositioning on view resize via `installEventFilter(self)` on the **view** (not the viewport).

### 8.9.3 Use viewport().geometry() for positioning, not view.width()/height()

`viewport().geometry()` is in the QGraphicsView's local coordinate space and already excludes scrollbars. Always use it as the bounding rect when computing overlay position.

```python
def _reposition(self) -> None:
    vp = self._canvas_view.viewport().geometry()
    x = vp.right()  - self.width()  - MARGIN
    y = vp.bottom() - self.height() - MARGIN - extra_clearance
    self.move(max(vp.left(), x), max(vp.top(), y))
    self.raise_()
```

### 8.9.4 Account for viewport-drawn overlays (scale bar, rulers)

The canvas draws a **scale bar** in the bottom-right corner and **rulers** along the top and left edges directly in the viewport's `paintEvent` — they are **not** separate widgets. Fixed overlays must clear their reserved space:

| Drawn overlay | Location | Reserved space |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Rulers (top & left) | top 20 px, left 20 px | `CanvasView.RULER_SIZE = 20` |
| Scale bar | bottom-right | `CanvasView.SCALE_BAR_RESERVED_PX = 40` |

```python
from open_garden_planner.ui.canvas.canvas_view import CanvasView

sb = CanvasView.SCALE_BAR_RESERVED_PX if self._canvas_view.scale_bar_visible else 0
y = vp.bottom() - self.height() - MARGIN - sb
```

### 8.9.5 Scene thumbnail rendering — Y-flip and item filtering

`QGraphicsScene.render()` renders in raw scene coordinates (Y increases downward). The canvas view applies a Y-flip transform. Flip the resulting pixmap:

```python
pixmap = scene.render(painter, target, source_rect)
thumbnail = pixmap.transformed(QTransform().scale(1, -1))
```

Before rendering, **hide screen-space overlay items** that would appear at wrong positions or wrong sizes in the thumbnail:

```python
hidden = []
for item in scene.items():
    if (item.isVisible() and (
        bool(item.flags() & QGraphicsItem.GraphicsItemFlag.ItemIgnoresTransformations)
        or item.zValue() >= 100          # temporary tool overlays
    )):
        item.setVisible(False)
        hidden.append(item)

# ... render ...

for item in hidden:
    item.setVisible(True)
```

`ItemIgnoresTransformations` is set on: measurement/constraint text labels, dimension display handles, angle display handles. **Stale claim corrected (issue #338):** this section used to say "Z-value ≥ 100 is set on: active measure tool lines, constraint preview geometry", implying z ≥ 100 is itself a reserved overlay band. That was already an oversimplification once multi-layer plans existed — every layer occupies its own `[z_order*100, z_order*100+100)` band, so a perfectly ordinary document item on layer 2+ also carries z ≥ 100 — and it is now additionally imprecise because per-object stacking (§8.25) spreads items across that whole per-layer band rather than pinning them to its floor. z is not the right test for "is this a tool overlay"; see §8.25's reserved-z-bands table for the actual fixed overlay ranges (900 and up), and note the illustrative snippet above predates that table — the live overlay-hiding code (`ui/widgets/minimap_widget.py`) uses its own named threshold, not a bare `100`.

**The hide/restore itself emits `scene.changed` — asynchronously — for transformable items.** A `setVisible()` on a transformable item queues `changed([rect])` and then a trailing `changed([])`, delivered on *two separate later event-loop turns* — both *after* the render method has returned; a `setVisible()` on an `ItemIgnoresTransformations` item emits nothing (measured, Qt 6.11 — every handle/label/badge in this app carries the flag, so in production only the curve-edit connector lines are affected). If the thumbnail refresh is (as it should be) driven by `scene.changed`, this is a self-sustaining loop: with a single transformable overlay item on the scene the minimap re-rendered the whole plan ~9×/s forever while idle (issue #305, §11.4). A plain in-call re-entrancy flag does **not** cover it, and a timing window (`singleShot(0)`) is both fragile across Qt versions and drops genuine changes that share the turn. The shipped pattern in `MinimapWidget` is **content-based**: `_do_update()` records `sceneBoundingRect()` of every *transformable* item it hid (the only ones that emit); the `changed` slot (`_on_scene_changed`) ignores an emission iff every rect lies inside one of those (an empty rect list is Qt's trailing no-op — measured, every genuine mutation carries ≥ 1 rect) and schedules a render otherwise. A toggled-off minimap early-returns before rendering at all.

**Rule — every slot connected to `scene.changed` (directly or via a debounce timer it restarts) must be idempotent: compute the final state per item, then apply it once.** Never call `update()`, `setVisible()`, `prepareGeometryChange()`, or add/remove items from such a slot unless the underlying value actually changed, and never do a "clear everything, then set" pass — the item setters' early-return guards (`GardenItemMixin.set_companion_highlight()`/`set_spacing_overlap()`/`set_antagonist_warning()`) cannot help when the handler forces the value through `None` each tick. Both patterns were live in #305: `CanvasView._update_soil_mismatches()` with an unconditional `item.update()` (one bed → loop), and `_update_spacing_overlaps()`/`_update_companion_highlights()` with a clear pass (one gallery-dropped plant → loop). `_update_container_capacity()` is the model to copy. To check a change for a new loop: settle the app for 1.5 s, then assert 0 `scene.changed` emissions and 0 `QGraphicsScene.render` calls over the next 2 s (`tests/integration/test_idle_scene_quiescence.py`).

### 8.9.6 Coordinate mapping with Y-flip

Minimap Y=0 is the **visual top** of the canvas, which corresponds to **scene Y = canvas_height** (max scene Y). All coordinate conversions must invert Y:

```python
# minimap pixel → scene
sx = canvas_rect.x() + (mx / w) * canvas_rect.width()
sy = canvas_rect.y() + canvas_rect.height() * (1.0 - my / h)   # inverted

# scene → minimap pixel (for viewport rect overlay)
ry = (canvas_rect.height() - (scene_max_y - canvas_rect.y())) * scale_y
```

### 8.9.7 Thumbnail aspect ratio — size the widget, don't letterbox

Never stretch a canvas thumbnail into a fixed aspect-ratio widget — this produces gray bars when the canvas has a different proportion. Instead, **resize the overlay widget** to match the canvas aspect ratio within maximum dimensions:

```python
if canvas_w / canvas_h > MAX_W / MAX_H:
    w, h = MAX_W, int(MAX_W * canvas_h / canvas_w)
else:
    h, w = MAX_H, int(MAX_H * canvas_w / canvas_h)
self.setFixedSize(w, h)
self._reposition()
```

### 8.9.8 Rotatable-item geometry invariant — keep `transformOriginPoint == rect().center()`

Rect-bearing items (`CircleItem`/`RectangleItem`/`EllipseItem`) serialize their position as `pos + rect.center()` with rotation stored as a *separate* angle pivoting on the centre (`core/project.py`). Every geometry mutation on such an item — rotate, programmatic resize, interactive drag-resize, and the undo/redo of any of them — **must end with `transformOriginPoint() == rect().center()`**, or a rotated item's saved centre diverges from its on-screen centre and it drifts on reload / jumps on the next rotation. Do not re-derive this per gesture. **Route every rect-backed resize through `ui/canvas/geometry_apply.py`** (US-D2.2): `apply_rect_like_geometry` is the `apply_func` every `ResizeItemCommand` must be given, and the `build_*_resize` helpers compute the target geometry for either anchor policy. Its module docstring is the authoritative list of callers and exceptions. Below it sit the two lower-level primitives, a coupled pair rather than pick-and-choose: `resize_handle.resize_rect_item_keeping_anchor(item, new_rect, scene_anchor, local_anchor)` (mutating: `prepareGeometryChange()`, apply rect, re-pin origin, reposition so a chosen scene point stays fixed), whose `scene_anchor` must come from the pure forward transform `scene_point_of` — never hand-derived — and `anchored_position`, the inverse form the `geometry_apply` builders solve `pos` through. **Never hand-derive a position beside a re-pin** — `anchored_position` bakes in `O = new_rect.center()`, so a `pos` computed by hand under the *old* origin and then combined with a re-pin is two half-solutions to one transform: that combination slid a rotated rectangle 671 cm out from under the cursor (§11.4). Rotation goes through `geometry_apply.apply_rotation`, the only definition in the codebase (it delegates to `RotationHandleMixin._apply_rotation`, which pivots on `rect().center()`). Note `ResizeItemCommand` accepts **two** callables — `apply_func` and each `partner_resizes` entry's — and both must obey this. For rect-backed items, the interactive `ResizeHandle._apply_resize` takes the fixed corner/edge **authoritatively from the handle position**, never inferred from scene-space, which disagrees with the item frame under rotation. It lets the item normalise the rect (`CircleItem._constrain_resize_size` squares it so the dragged handle tracks the cursor — never `min(w,h)`, which collapses under rotation), then refreshes via `_after_resize_geometry()`. The non-rect fallback (PolygonItem) is exact compensation, not an alignment accident: it rotates the local delta into scene space (`pos_dx * cos_a - pos_dy * sin_a`) before applying it, so the dragged edge tracks the cursor and the opposite edge stays fixed under rotation too. The pivot must come from the *geometric* `rect()`, never the decoration-expanded `boundingRect()` (a runtime-only badge expands the latter asymmetrically); and any shrink of a custom `boundingRect()` must `prepareGeometryChange()` or Qt leaves a stale "ghost". See ADR-028 and §11.4 (#218/#219). Sizing precedence (footprint vs. spacing override vs. DB `max_spread_cm`) likewise has one home: the Qt-free `core/plant_sizing.py` resolver.

## 8.10 Integration Test Policy

**Every user story (US) must ship with at least one end-to-end integration test. No merge without it. No exceptions.**

### Rationale

Unit tests and widget tests protect individual components but cannot catch regressions in the interaction between tools, canvas, and scene — the most failure-prone area of the app. Integration tests lock in observed behavior so that refactoring and feature additions don't silently break existing workflows.

### Test location

All integration tests live in `tests/integration/`. Shared fixtures are in `tests/integration/conftest.py`.

### Per-test timeout (hang guard)

Every test runs under `pytest-timeout` (`timeout = 180` in `pyproject.toml`; dev dependency). A hung full-app test therefore fails loudly instead of silently freezing the battery (§11.4, 2026-08-17). If a legitimate test needs longer, mark it `@pytest.mark.timeout(N)` with a comment saying why — do not raise the global value.

### Minimum requirement per US

Each US must have at least one test that exercises its **primary workflow** end to end:

1. Activate the relevant tool (if applicable)
2. Simulate the user gesture (mouse press → move → release)
3. Assert the resulting scene state (item created, property changed, item removed, etc.)

### How tool interaction is tested

Tools expose a direct API that bypasses the Qt event pipeline while still testing real business logic:

```python
tool.mouse_press(event, scene_pos: QPointF)
tool.mouse_move(event, scene_pos: QPointF)
tool.mouse_release(event, scene_pos: QPointF)
```

- `event`: `MagicMock(spec=QMouseEvent)` with `event.button.return_value = Qt.MouseButton.LeftButton`
- `scene_pos`: Qt Y-down scene coordinates (not canvas Y-up coordinates)
- Always disable snapping in tests: `view.set_snap_enabled(False)`

### Standard fixture pattern

```python
@pytest.fixture
def canvas(qtbot):
    scene = CanvasScene(width_cm=5000, height_cm=3000)
    view = CanvasView(scene)
    qtbot.addWidget(view)
    view.set_snap_enabled(False)
    return view
```

### Coordinate system reminder

> **Framing note.** The "Y-down / (0,0) top-left" label below is Qt's *abstract*
> convention for the raw scene numbers, kept here for test-authoring mechanics (a
> tool test passes raw `scene_pos` numbers and the compass doesn't matter). OGP's
> view applies `scale(zoom, -zoom)`, so those *same* raw coordinates render
> **Y-up**: a larger scene y is visually higher = **north** (§11.4 "Canvas Y-axis
> flip" is the operative rule). That is why the Agent API — which reports the
> identical raw scene y — describes the frame as "origin bottom-left, +y north."
> Both statements are true of the same numbers; they differ only in whether they
> name Qt's storage convention or the on-screen compass.

- **Scene coordinates** (Y-down abstract convention, what tools receive): `(0, 0)` is top-left
- **Canvas coordinates** (Y-up, what the user sees): `(0, 0)` is bottom-left, +y north
- Pass scene coordinates to tool methods; use `view.scene_to_canvas()` / `view.canvas_to_scene()` when conversion is needed

### What integration tests cover

| Category | File | Tests |
|----------|------|-------|
| Drawing workflows | `test_drawing_workflows.py` | Rectangle, Circle, Polygon, Text, cancel |
| Tool switching | `test_tool_switching.py` | Default tool, switch, cancel-on-switch, Escape |
| Selection & resize | `test_selection_and_resize.py` | Select, deselect, move, mid-edge constraint, corner |
| Undo/Redo | `test_undo_redo.py` | Draw→undo, draw→undo→redo, move→undo, multi-action stack |

### CI

Integration tests run automatically in CI (`ci.yml`) alongside unit and widget tests. Qt rendering uses `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` — no display server required.

### Render tier (opt-in, Phase 17)

The `offscreen` platform plugin selects Qt Quick's *software* scene graph, which renders no 3D at all — an empty frame, not a wrong one. Tests that must see a real Qt Quick 3D frame therefore form an opt-in **render tier**, skipped unless `OGP_RENDER3D=1` and a display are present:

```bash
OGP_RENDER3D=1 QSG_RHI_BACKEND=opengl QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 \
  xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1920x1080x24" \
  venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration/test_spike_q3d_render.py
```

The tier is **Linux/X11-only**: it forces `xcb` + OpenGL and is skipped without `DISPLAY` (Mesa llvmpipe in a container needs `libegl1` and `libxcb-cursor0`). On Windows the same probes run through the spike itself — `--spike-q3d … --iou --orient --pick …` in the dev venv or the frozen exe — and are judged from its `metrics.json`. Its module fixtures run a full render subprocess, which outlasts the global 180 s per-test timeout, so the tier carries its own `pytest.mark.timeout`. The render runs in a subprocess, and its assertions are about **meaning, never pixel-exact goldens**: shadow-map footprint vs the analytic shadow (IoU ≥ 0.85), north-up ground, the sky's sun at the solar azimuth, 20/20 picks against a CPU oracle, WebEngine and 3D drawing in one process, a clean exit while animating. Headless render tooling writes its own timestamped log and per-phase metrics and arms a watchdog, because a frozen GUI exe has no stdout (§11.4.5). A permanent CI job for this tier is planned with the production engine package (Phase 17, L1.2).

### 8.10.1 Gating our own documentation's shell commands

`tests/unit/test_gate_commands.py` is a static guard over the **commands our
documentation tells people to run** — a category distinct from both unit and
integration tests, and added after a self-inflicted defect worth recording.

The frozen-exe `--selftest` gate was written into several documents at once and
was wrong twice in two commits: first as a naked call PowerShell does not wait
on (returns in ~6 ms with an empty exit code — the gate passes unconditionally),
then with the outer string double-quoted so **bash** expanded `$p` before
PowerShell saw it (`= Start-Process …; exit .ExitCode` — the gate fails
unconditionally, and never launches the exe). Four review rounds used the word
"verified" before anyone executed it.

**What the guard does.** Two rules. **(1)** The command literal may live only in
`SANCTIONED_HOMES` — the canonical definition (`ogp-change-control` §2.8), its
mechanics (`ogp-build-and-run`) and the `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` Quick Reference;
every other document must **cite §2.8 by name**. **(2)** Wherever it does appear,
the command must actually work: no `$`/backtick construct bash would expand
first, and a shape (`$p = Start-Process … -Wait -PassThru … exit $p.ExitCode`)
that makes the gate capable of failing.

Rule 1 exists because the first version of this guard did the opposite. Told that
eight documents prescribed a weaker gate, it copied the corrected command into
ten more and policed eighteen copies — in a change whose stated thesis is that a
second copy of a gate list is how a gate goes missing.

**How to test this pattern.** Three rules, each bought with a failure:

1. **Model the shell, not the tokens.** The first implementation used
   `shlex.split(posix=True)` and passed on the known-broken line — `shlex` models
   quoting but not `$`-expansion.
2. **Cover substitution, not just `$NAME`.** The second version was bypassed with
   PowerShell's `$?` idiom, where bash substitutes its own exit status and
   PowerShell then evaluates a constant. `$(…)`, backticks and the special
   parameters all belong in the model.
3. **Pin the teeth against the real defects.** The guard carries the literal
   shipped-broken lines as test cases, so a later simplification cannot quietly
   regress it to a version that passed on them.

Verify a guard of this kind by reintroducing the defect and watching it go red;
a guard that has never been observed failing is an assertion, not a test.

**Documentation identifiers are gated like code.** `tests/unit/test_skill_citations.py`
(`scripts/check_skill_citations.py`, issue #336) resolves every `§N.M`/`section N.M`,
`ADR-0NN`, `FR-*`, and `#NNN` citation in the `SKILL.md` files (both `.claude/skills/`
and `.agents/skills/`) plus `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` against the real headings, ADR
index, FR index, and a committed GitHub snapshot (`tests/data/issue_registry.json`,
refreshed via `scripts/refresh_issue_registry.py`) — plus every `` `file.py:line` ``
citation that is actually spelled in the gated form: `` `path.py:N` `` immediately
followed on the same line by a backtick-quoted symbol, e.g. `` `core/object_types.py:671`
`is_bed_type` ``. **A `file.py:line` citation with no trailing symbol is rejected
outright** — an earlier version of this gate made the symbol optional and fell back
to a line-count-only check, which is how that same citation, then wrong by 76 lines
(`core/object_types.py:595/608/622`), sat undetected even after the gate shipped (see
§11.4). A citation spelled out in prose, or as a markdown link (`` [text](path.py#L123) ``),
is invisible to this gate entirely — the same blind spot the i18n gate has for a
string that never reaches `tr()`; normalize a citation into the gated form to bring
it under the gate. It resolves *identifiers*, not *claims* — a citation only has to
point at something that still exists, tolerantly (a `file.py:line` citation passes
if its named symbol, plus any string literal alongside it, is found within 20 lines
of the cited line — small enough to catch every drift incident measured so far,
generous enough that trivial churn doesn't cry wolf). It is **not** a check on how
*selective* the named symbol is: a citation naming a short, common identifier in a
large file (e.g. `execute` in a 2800-line command module) still resolves against a
large fraction of that file's possible line numbers — real but weak protection,
tracked as a named residual rather than a false "resolved" claim (§11.4). §11.4 also
records the rot rate that motivated the gate.

## 8.11 Security Scanning (SAST)

**Tool:** [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) — a Python SAST tool that detects common security anti-patterns (subprocess injection, unsafe deserialization, weak cryptography, hardcoded secrets, etc.).

**CI enforcement:** The `security` job in `ci.yml` runs `bandit -r src/ --severity-level high` on every push. CI fails only on HIGH-severity findings. MEDIUM and LOW findings are printed in the log for awareness but do not block merges.

**Local use:**
```bash
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m bandit -r src/ --severity-level high

# See ALL findings (MEDIUM + LOW) for awareness:
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m bandit -r src/
```

**Suppressing a false positive** (use sparingly — always add a justification comment):
```python
result = subprocess.run(cmd)  # nosec B603 — cmd is constructed internally, never from user input
```

**Scope:** `src/` only. Test files are excluded — `assert` statements and test helpers are intentional and not security-relevant.

**Agent API exposure (US-D1.1, §8.19):** the embedded MCP server is a network listener. It is **on by default but read-only** and **bound to `127.0.0.1` only** (never `0.0.0.0`/LAN — so Bandit's B104 does not apply); a Preferences toggle disables it. Default-on is acceptable while read-only (a garden layout isn't sensitive) and removes the discovery friction for AI clients. Reads have no auth (loopback trust). **Writes (US-D2.0 through D2.6, including `undo`/`redo`) are token-gated**: the scene-mutating tools ship only when the user enables editing (off by default) AND require the token — presented in the connect URL as a `?token=` query param (the reliable route; some clients don't transmit auth headers on tool calls) or as an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header — checked with constant-time comparison. A default-on, unauthenticated *mutate* surface reachable by any local process is exactly what this prevents (ADR-036, §8.19); delivering the token in the URL keeps that protection (a caller still needs the secret) at the cost of a URL-borne secret — mitigated by disabling the uvicorn access log and stripping the `token` param from the request scope right after extraction, so the residual exposure is the client's own config. The gate is per-tool so read-only clients are unaffected. The pre-bind port check uses a plain `socket.bind` and is not a high-severity finding.

**Browser reachability (DNS rebinding) — #396, ADR-033 addendum.** Loopback binding and token gating reason about a *local process* (an MCP client the user launched). They do not cover a **browser**, which is a local process acting for a remote page: a page on `evil.example` can reach `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`, and loopback binding does not stop it because the request originates on this machine. The only barrier is the transport's `Host`/`Origin` validation, so that guard is now **explicitly configured by OGP** rather than inherited from the mcp SDK:

- `agent_api/server.py::build_server(..., host=..., port=...)` constructs `TransportSecuritySettings(enable_dns_rebinding_protection=True, allowed_hosts=[...], allowed_origins=[...])` and passes it to `FastMCP(transport_security=...)`. The lists name the **exact** `host:port` pairs (bind address, `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, the IPv6 loopback literal) with **no `:*` port wildcard** — the port is fixed for the server's life, so a wildcard would only restore the breadth of the SDK default being replaced.
- A hostile `Host` is answered **421**; a hostile `Origin` **403**. Verified against the frozen exe, not only in pytest: loopback `Host` 200, `localhost` 200, `evil.example` 421, loopback `Origin` 200, `http(s)://evil.example` 403.
- **The `mcp>=1.23` dependency floor is a security control, not a version bump.** 1.23.0 is the first release whose FastMCP auto-enables the loopback guard. Measured: under the previous floor (`>=1.12`) a 1.22.0 wheel answered a crafted `Host: evil.example` initialize with **HTTP 200 and a full MCP result**, across all six hostile variants, where 1.30.0 answers 421/403. No shipped exe is known to be exposed — every release happened to bundle a 1.30-era wheel — but the exposure was a property of *whichever wheel resolved at build time* rather than of the product.
- **Test-design consequence.** The black-box 421/403 tests are necessary but not sufficient: with mcp 1.30.0 installed they pass *even with the explicit settings deleted*, and so does a naive "settings object is not None and the flag is True" assertion, because the SDK auto-enable returns exactly such an object. `tests/integration/test_agent_api_dns_rebinding.py` therefore also asserts what the SDK default cannot satisfy — that `allowed_hosts` names the **bound port**, and that nothing is a wildcard. Deleting the `transport_security=` argument fails 3 of its 4 object-level tests.
- **Reads remain unauthenticated** (loopback trust, the audit's challenged decision C2). This closes the *browser* vector; it does not re-open that one. The #355 input boundary additionally rejects non-finite/null/oversized callout offsets before Qt construction, so an authenticated caller cannot turn a write token into unbounded scene geometry. D2.6 reuses the same finite/canvas-relative reachability check for absolute positions and vertices before constructing `QPointF` geometry.

## 8.12 Constraint Solver Architecture

The constraint solver lives in [`core/constraints.py`](../../src/open_garden_planner/core/constraints.py) and [`core/constraint_solver_newton.py`](../../src/open_garden_planner/core/constraint_solver_newton.py). It supports 16 constraint types and runs in two phases.

### 8.12.1 Constraint types

Defined in `ConstraintType`. Grouped by the invariant they express:

| Category | Types |
|---|---|
| Dimensional (scale-sensitive) | `EDGE_LENGTH`, `DISTANCE`, `HORIZONTAL_DISTANCE`, `VERTICAL_DISTANCE`, `POINT_ON_CIRCLE`, `ANGLE` |
| Positional | `COINCIDENT`, `POINT_ON_EDGE`, `SYMMETRY_HORIZONTAL`, `SYMMETRY_VERTICAL`, `FIXED` |
| Orientation (scale-invariant) | `HORIZONTAL`, `VERTICAL`, `PARALLEL`, `PERPENDICULAR`, `EQUAL` |

### 8.12.2 Two-phase solve

Every `solve_anchored` call runs in two phases:

1. **Gauss-Seidel warm start** — each constraint is resolved by a 1D projection along its own direction. Cheap, robust for decoupled systems, converges in O(N) iterations when the constraints don't share variables in geometrically independent directions.
2. **Newton-Raphson refinement** — runs when the Gauss-Seidel residual exceeds tolerance. Treats the free variables as a single vector `x`, builds a residual vector `F(x)` from all non-orientation constraints, and takes damped Newton steps on `J · Δx = −F`. The Jacobian is computed numerically via central differences (`h = 1e-3 cm`); the step uses `numpy.linalg.lstsq` so rank-deficient systems yield a minimum-norm step. Armijo backtracking (α halves per failed step) accepts only moves that strictly reduce `max|F|`.

Convergence criterion: `max|F| ≤ tolerance` (default 0.1 cm; 1.0 cm for drag-time solves where cm-level drift is invisible). Caps: 20 Gauss-Seidel iterations, 25 Newton iterations, 15 backtrack steps.

### 8.12.3 Why two phases

Gauss-Seidel alone fails on coupled systems — the canonical case is two `EDGE_LENGTH` constraints sharing a vertex. The feasible vertex position is the intersection of two circles, which cannot be reached by alternating 1D projections. Newton handles the 2D move. In the non-coupled majority case, Newton returns immediately because Gauss-Seidel already hit tolerance.

### 8.12.4 Geometric fast path

For the shared-vertex EDGE_LENGTH case, `two_circle_intersection()` in `constraint_solver_newton` provides a closed-form solution. Returns the intersection root nearest the current vertex; returns `None` for non-intersecting circles so the caller can fall back to Newton.

### 8.12.5 Live vertex drag projection

`ConstraintGraph.project_to_feasible()` is called from the vertex-drag `mouseMove` path. It pins every variable except the moving vertex, runs Newton on just the constraints touching that vertex, and returns the closest feasible point to the raw cursor position. Short-circuits when no constraint touches the vertex — zero cost for unconstrained drags.

### 8.12.6 Scale handle blocking

`_has_blocking_constraints()` in `ui/canvas/items/resize_handle.py` guards bounding-box resize handles. Orientation-only constraint types (`HORIZONTAL`, `VERTICAL`, `PARALLEL`, `PERPENDICULAR`, `EQUAL`) are scale-invariant and permit resize; any other constraint — including `FIXED`, `EDGE_LENGTH`, `DISTANCE`, `ANGLE`, `SYMMETRY_*`, `COINCIDENT`, `POINT_ON_*` — blocks the drag and emits a translated status-bar hint.

### 8.12.7 Conflict detection on add

Before executing an `AddConstraintCommand`, the canvas view trial-runs the solver with the proposed constraint via `ConstraintGraph.find_conflicting_constraints()`. Existing constraints whose post-solve residual exceeds 1.0 cm are flagged. The user is shown a `ConstraintConflictDialog` (Override / Cancel) rather than letting the solver silently distort existing geometry.

### 8.12.8 Residual formulas (per type, scaled to cm)

| Type | Residual |
|---|---|
| `EDGE_LENGTH`, `DISTANCE`, `POINT_ON_CIRCLE` | `|P_a − P_b| − L` |
| `HORIZONTAL` | `a_y − b_y` |
| `VERTICAL` | `a_x − b_x` |
| `HORIZONTAL_DISTANCE` | `(b_x − a_x) − sign · L` |
| `VERTICAL_DISTANCE` | `(b_y − a_y) − sign · L` |
| `COINCIDENT` | `(a_x − b_x, a_y − b_y)` — 2 residuals |
| `SYMMETRY_HORIZONTAL` | `(b_x − a_x, a_y + b_y − 2·axis_y)` |
| `SYMMETRY_VERTICAL` | `(b_y − a_y, a_x + b_x − 2·axis_x)` |
| `POINT_ON_EDGE` | perpendicular distance from point to edge |
| `ANGLE` | `(acos(ba·bc / (|ba|·|bc|)) − θ_target) · min(|ba|, |bc|)` |
| `PARALLEL`, `PERPENDICULAR`, `EQUAL`, `FIXED` | handled in warm-start; Newton skips |

**Adding new checks:** If a feature introduces a new code pattern that warrants attention (e.g. cryptography, XML parsing, network server code), review the relevant Bandit rule IDs and verify the CI job covers them.

## 8.13 Soil Health Tracking (US-12.10)

Per-bed soil tests are stored on the project itself, not on individual canvas items, so that historical records survive bed deletion and rotation. The model is intentionally minimal in 12.10a — entry + persistence — and is extended by 12.10b–e (canvas overlay, amendment calculator, plant-soil warnings, history sparklines).

### 8.13.1 Data hierarchy

```
.ogp file
└── "soil_tests" : { target_id → SoilTestHistory }
                    target_id ∈ { <bed-uuid>, "global" }
```

Effective record for a bed = bed's latest record → falls back to global latest → `None`. The fallback chain is implemented in `SoilService.get_effective_record` (`src/open_garden_planner/services/soil_service.py`) and used by every consumer (overlay, amendment calc, mismatch warnings).

### 8.13.2 Rapitest categorical scale

| Field | Range | Labels |
|---|---|---|
| `n_level`, `p_level` | 0–4 | Depleted / Deficient / Adequate / Sufficient / Surplus |
| `k_level` | 1–4 | (no K0 on the kit) — Deficient / Adequate / Sufficient / Surplus |
| `ca_level`, `mg_level`, `s_level` | 0–2 | Low / Medium / High |

Lab-mode ppm values (`*_ppm`) are stored alongside the categorical fields so they survive between sub-stories without a second data migration; conversion ppm → categorical lands in 12.10c.

### 8.13.3 Persistence & file version

The dedicated top-level `"soil_tests"` key was introduced with file version **1.3**. Older v1.2 files load with `soil_tests = {}`; re-saving silently upgrades the file to v1.3. There is no automatic downgrade — opening a v1.3 file in an older binary fails the version gate (existing convention).

### 8.13.4 Undo integration

`AddSoilTestCommand` (in `core/commands.py`) snapshots the prior history dict for the target and restores it on undo. This means undoing the very first record for a bed deletes the `target_id` key entirely, while undoing an N-th record restores history of length N-1.

### 8.13.5 Canvas overlay (US-12.10b)

The toggleable soil-health overlay tints each bed by a chosen parameter (Overall / pH / N / P / K). It is painted in `CanvasView.drawForeground` — **never** in `CanvasScene.drawForeground` — so it is automatically excluded from PNG / SVG / PDF / print exports, all of which call `scene.render()` (which only invokes scene-level draw hooks). This mirrors how the grid and ruler-guide overlays are scoped.

Bed shapes are mapped via `item.mapToScene(item.shape())` so rotated beds stay correctly tinted (a `boundingRect()`-based path would over-paint).

The colour mapping lives in `SoilService.health_level(record, parameter)` and `SoilService.overlay_rgba(level)`:

| Level | RGBA tint | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| GOOD | (100, 200, 100, 80) | pH 6.0–7.0; NPK ≥ 3 |
| FAIR | (255, 200, 0, 80) | pH 5.5–<6.0 / >7.0–7.5; NPK = 2 |
| POOR | (220, 60, 60, 80) | otherwise |
| UNKNOWN | grey `DiagCrossPattern` (alpha 40) | no record at all |

For `"overall"`, the worst non-unknown level across pH/N/P/K wins (all-unknown stays unknown).

The `SoilService` is a single long-lived instance owned by `GardenPlannerApp` and injected into `CanvasView` via `set_soil_service`. The soil-test-entry dialog reuses the same instance, so dialog edits and overlay tint stay consistent without re-querying `ProjectManager.soil_tests`.

### 8.13.6 Amendment calculation (US-12.10c)

`SoilService.calculate_amendments(record, target_ph, target_n, target_p, target_k, bed_area_m2, loader)` is a **pure static method** — no I/O, no service state. Tests assert quantities trivially; the canvas overlay (8.13.5) and the amendment dialogs share the exact same code path.

**Formula** (from roadmap §1976-2030):

```
pH:  qty_g = |target_ph - current_ph| / |effect_per_100g_m2| * 100 * area_m2
NPK: qty_g = (target_level - current_level) * application_rate_g_m2 * area_m2
```

**Priority walk** (one pass, each substance picked at most once):

1. pH (only if `|delta| ≥ 0.1` — below this is measurement noise).
2. N → P → K (any deficit ≥ 1 Rapitest step).
3. Ca → Mg → S, but only if the pH/NPK picks didn't already supply them — e.g. dolomite lime decrements both Ca and Mg deficits before gypsum is considered.

Returns `[]` for `record is None`, `bed_area_m2 <= 0`, or no deficits.

**Data file**: `src/open_garden_planner/resources/data/amendments.json` (12 substances). Loaded once by `AmendmentLoader`, eagerly validated; corrupt JSON raises at startup rather than mid-dialog.

**Two surfaces** consume the same calculator:

| Surface | File | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Inline per-bed list | `SoilTestDialog._refresh_amendments` | Hidden when `bed_area_m2 == 0` (i.e. global default test). Recomputes live as the form values change. |
| Cross-bed plan | `AmendmentPlanDialog` | Walks every bed, groups by substance, sums grams. "Copy to clipboard" is the fallback for US-12.6 shopping-list integration. |

**Targets** default to the same "ideal" definition the canvas overlay (8.13.5) uses for GOOD: `pH 6.5`, `N=P=K=3`. Per-bed overrides are not persisted — 12.10d will derive plant-aware targets from species in the bed.

**EllipseItem note**: `core.measurements.calculate_area_and_perimeter` does not yet support `EllipseItem`. Beds drawn as ellipses are skipped (the calculator returns `[]` for `area=0`). This is a pre-existing gap, tracked separately.

### 8.13.7 Plant-soil compatibility warnings (US-12.10d)

`SoilService.get_mismatched_plants(record, plant_specs)` is a pure static method that compares the effective bed record against each hosted plant's pH window (with a ±0.05 tolerance — only enough to absorb float-rounding from the dialog's 0.1-step pH spinbox) and "high" NPK demand. It returns `[(spec, [reason, …]), …]`. The view layer (`CanvasView._update_soil_mismatches`, debounced 500 ms on `scene.changed`) walks every bed, calls the calculator, and sets `_soil_mismatch_level` on the bed item: `"warning"` for exactly one reason across all hosted plants, `"critical"` for ≥2. `GardenItemMixin._draw_soil_mismatch_border` paints an amber or red border (4 px) outside the rotation ring; a tooltip joins the per-plant reasons. The Dashboard mirrors the warnings via `PlantingCalendarView._inject_soil_mismatch_tasks` (one amber card per mismatched bed). Plant species expose `n_demand`/`p_demand`/`k_demand`; legacy `nutrient_demand="heavy"` falls back to `high` for all three macros via `_effective_demand`.

### 8.13.8 History sparklines & seasonal reminder badge (US-12.10e)

The `SoilTestDialog` is split into two tabs (`QTabWidget`):

| Tab     | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Entry   | Existing form (date, mode, pH, Kit/Lab nutrient panel, amendments, notes). |
| History | Past tests listed date-descending + four `SoilSparklineWidget` charts (pH, N, P, K). Ca/Mg/S still appear in the past-tests list but get no sparkline. |

`SoilSparklineWidget` is a single-parameter QPainter line chart with an auto-scaled y-range bounded to parameter semantics (pH 0–14, NPK 0–4). 0 records → "No history yet" placeholder; 1 record → centred dot; ≥2 → polyline + dots with min/max-y labels and first/last-date labels.

**Seasonal reminder.** `SoilService.is_test_overdue(history, today)` is pure: returns `True` only when `today.month ∈ {3, 4, 9, 10}`, the bed has been tested before, and the latest record is older than 180 days (or its date is unparseable). Untested beds (None / empty history) are deliberately *not* flagged — the badge nudges re-testing, not first-testing.

**Badge.** `SoilBadgeItem` is a `QGraphicsObject` (so it can carry a `pyqtSignal`) with `ItemIgnoresTransformations` so it stays 16 × 16 px regardless of zoom. It anchors to the bed's top-right corner (8 px screen-fixed offset, view-scale-aware just like `RotationHandle`). Click → `clicked = pyqtSignal(str)` carrying the bed UUID; `CanvasView` re-emits as `soil_test_badge_clicked`, which the `Application` wires into the same `_open_soil_test_dialog` flow used by the bed context menu.

Lifecycle: the existing 500 ms debounce timer in `CanvasView.set_soil_service` (introduced for 12.10d mismatch borders) was extended — its `timeout` now calls `_on_soil_debounce_tick` which runs both `_update_soil_mismatches()` and `_update_soil_badges()`. After a soil-test save, `Application._open_soil_test_dialog` calls `refresh_soil_badges()` for an immediate clear (so the badge disappears before the debounce window elapses).

## 8.14 Bed-Specific Features Across All Shape Items (US-12.8 follow-up)

**Why this section exists.** Bed-capable shapes are not one class but four — historical reasons:

| Shape class    | Default bed object_type | Tool that creates it |
|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| `RectangleItem`| `RAISED_BED`            | `Raised Bed` tool    |
| `PolygonItem`  | `GARDEN_BED`            | `Garden Bed` tool    |
| `EllipseItem`  | `GARDEN_BED`            | Generic ellipse → change type |
| `CircleItem`   | `GARDEN_BED`            | Generic circle → change type  |

Twice in three months a new bed-only feature shipped missing from one or more shapes (Pest log on PolygonItem/EllipseItem — fixed in #173; Plan Anbaufolge on all three non-rectangle shapes — fixed post-US-12.8). Root cause: each shape's `contextMenuEvent` hand-rolled its own bed-action block, and there was no test that caught a missed shape.

**Central pattern.** Bed-specific actions are built by **one** method on `GardenItemMixin`:

```python
# garden_item.py
@dataclass(slots=True)
class BedMenuActions:
    toggle_grid: QAction | None = None
    add_soil_test: QAction | None = None
    log_pest_disease: QAction | None = None
    log_harvest: QAction | None = None        # US-C1
    plan_succession: QAction | None = None

def build_bed_context_menu(
    self, menu: QMenu, *, grid_enabled: bool,
    supports_grid: bool = True, supports_soil: bool = True,   # supports_soil: US-C3b
) -> BedMenuActions: ...

def dispatch_bed_action(self, action: QAction | None, actions: BedMenuActions) -> bool: ...
```

`supports_grid=False` drops the grid toggle (round/vertical shapes); `supports_soil=False` drops **only** the soil-test action (the trellis — a plant-parent that holds no soil — keeps pest/harvest/succession). Every **plant-parent** shape's `contextMenuEvent` follows the same skeleton (the guard is `is_plant_parent_type`, not `is_bed_type`, so the trellis is included — US-C3b):

```python
bed_actions = BedMenuActions()
if is_plant_parent_type(self.object_type):
    soil = is_bed_type(self.object_type)   # trellis → False; beds/containers → True
    bed_actions = self.build_bed_context_menu(
        menu, grid_enabled=self._grid_enabled,
        supports_grid=soil,                # round shapes pass False regardless
        supports_soil=soil,
    )
# ...assemble the rest of the menu...
action = menu.exec(event.screenPos())
if self.dispatch_bed_action(action, bed_actions):
    return
# ...handle shape-specific actions...
```

**Why a mixin method, not a base class.** `GardenItemMixin` is already shared by all four shapes; adding methods there avoids a deeper refactor and keeps the change minimal. The mixin handles `request_soil_test`, `request_pest_log`, `request_harvest_log`, `request_succession_plan` view dispatch and the grid-toggle side effect (`scene.selectionChanged.emit()`) so each shape only has to translate its surrounding non-bed menu items.

**Regression test (the part that prevents recurrence).** `tests/integration/test_bed_context_menu.py` parametrises across every plant-parent shape (incl. containers + trellis) and asserts the soil-test is present iff `supports_soil`:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("factory,supports_grid,supports_soil", BED_SHAPES)
def test_bed_context_menu_has_all_features(factory, supports_grid, supports_soil, qtbot):
    item = factory()
    menu = QMenu()
    actions = item.build_bed_context_menu(
        menu, grid_enabled=False, supports_grid=supports_grid, supports_soil=supports_soil)
    assert actions.log_pest_disease is not None
    assert actions.log_harvest is not None
    assert actions.plan_succession is not None
    assert (actions.add_soil_test is not None) == supports_soil   # trellis → None
    assert (actions.toggle_grid is not None) == supports_grid
```

**Adding a future bed feature** (the playbook):

1. Add a `QAction | None` field to `BedMenuActions`.
2. Add `actions.<new_field> = menu.addAction(...)` in `build_bed_context_menu`.
3. Add a routing branch in `dispatch_bed_action` that calls a `request_*` method on the canvas view.
4. Add the matching `request_*` method + signal on `CanvasView`.
5. Wire the signal in `Application.__init__`.
6. **Extend `test_bed_context_menu.py` with one new `assert actions.<new_field> is not None` line per parametrised shape.**

If you forget step 1–5 the existing test still passes; if you forget step 6 the test will not catch a future regression. The single-line addition in step 6 is the linchpin — treat it as mandatory.

**Upright text badges on the Y-flipped canvas.** Related lesson from the same bug batch: text drawn via `painter.drawText()` inside an item's `paint()` inherits the view's `scale(zoom, -zoom)` and renders **upside-down**. Use `QGraphicsSimpleTextItem` (or a custom `QGraphicsItem` subclass) as a **child** of the item with `ItemIgnoresTransformations`. See `SuccessionBadgeItem` in `garden_item.py` for the multi-line-with-pill-background example; bed name labels (`_label_item`) use `QGraphicsSimpleTextItem` for the simple single-line case.

Cross-references: ADR-017 (decision rationale), `tests/integration/test_bed_context_menu.py` (enforcement), `tests/integration/test_succession.py::TestSuccessionBadgeIndicator` (badge state machine).

**Update (US-C3 — containers join the soil predicate).** `is_bed_type()` is now the **soil-capable** predicate, not literally "bed": it returns true for `GARDEN_BED`, `RAISED_BED`, **and** the container types `CONTAINER`/`CONTAINER_ROUND`/`WALL_PLANTER`. So containers ride the same `build_bed_context_menu` path and bed-feature playbook above with no extra work. The parent/relationship behaviour (reparenting, drag/copy propagation, "Contained Plants", **and the bed-style context menu**) gates on a second predicate `is_plant_parent_type()` = soil containers **plus** `TRELLIS` (a plant-parent that holds no soil). When adding a feature, pick the predicate by seam: soil → `is_bed_type`; parent/relationship → `is_plant_parent_type`. The four shape items call `build_bed_context_menu(..., supports_grid=…, supports_soil=…)` under an `is_plant_parent_type` guard; for the trellis both flags are `False` (via `is_bed_type(self.object_type)`), so it shows **Pest / Harvest / Succession** but no Grid / Soil-test (US-C3b). The **grid overlay** stays purely on `is_bed_type` — a grid on a vertical surface is meaningless. Container fill is measured by height in litres via the Qt-free `core/container_model.py` (not bed soil-depth). See ADR-031.

## 8.15 Google Maps API Key for the Satellite Background Picker (ADR-019)

**Worker shutdown.** `MapPickerDialog` must never call `QThread.wait()` for the Static Maps worker: a single `requests.get(timeout=10)` cannot observe interruption until the response or timeout. The dialog's `reject()` and `closeEvent()` paths share one asynchronous cancellation request and the dialog rejects only from the worker's terminal signal; `GardenPlannerApp` tracks the modal picker so application shutdown enters the same path. Unexpected exceptions are logged only after formatting and `_scrub_key()` redaction; the user-facing message remains generic. `tests/integration/test_map_picker_dialog.py::TestFetchFlow::test_close_does_not_block_on_in_flight_worker` pins the non-blocking lifecycle and `test_worker_logs_scrubbed_traceback_for_unexpected_failure` pins secret exclusion.

**What needs the key.** The "File → Load Satellite Background…" menu opens `MapPickerDialog`, which uses two Google Maps Platform APIs:

| API | Used for | Free tier |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| Maps JS API | The embedded picker map (display + drawing + Places Autocomplete) | Free for display in apps (no $200 credit deduction) |
| Static Maps API | The final satellite image fetch (1–9 calls per import, depending on bbox size) | $200/month credit → ~100k calls free |

**Key location, in priority order:**

1. A non-empty key in `Preferences`, stored at `api_keys/google_maps_key` in the application's per-user QSettings store.
2. `OGP_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` from the process environment. In a source checkout, `main.py` loads this from the project-root `.env`; a packaged build also supports an adjacent `.env` next to the executable.

Preferences takes precedence. Leaving the Preferences field blank keeps the environment/`.env` fallback active; clearing a previously saved value therefore restores that fallback. The key is never copied from the environment into QSettings.

When the key is absent, the menu item is disabled and its tooltip explains where to set it. There is no fallback to a different provider — the dialog is unavailable until the user provides a key.

**One-time setup (developer):**

1. Sign in to <https://console.cloud.google.com/> with the Google account that should pay for any overage.
2. Create a project ("Open Garden Planner Dev").
3. Enable the three APIs the dialog needs: **Maps JavaScript API**, **Places API**, **Maps Static API**.
4. *Billing → Budgets & alerts*: create a budget alert at €1/month so you get pinged if anything ever escapes the $200 free credit.
5. *APIs & Services → Credentials*: create an API key. Restrict it: **API restrictions** = the three APIs above only. **Application restrictions** can stay on "None" for desktop use (HTTP-referrer/IP/Android-package restrictions don't apply to a `.exe`).
6. Put the key in Preferences, or use the environment fallback. For a source checkout, the latter can be the project-root `.env`; for a packaged build, place `.env` next to the executable:

   ```dotenv
   OGP_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY=AIza...
   ```

**Never bundle the key into the release `.exe`.** Anything pinned into the PyInstaller binary can be extracted with `strings` and abused on your bill. Specifically:

- The CI release workflow must NOT inject the secret into the build artifact.
- A GitHub-Action secret is only safe if it stays in CI (e.g. for an integration test) and never ends up in the shipped `.exe`.
- Distributing the key to other users requires them to obtain their own (cheap, ~5 minutes via the steps above).

**Mosaic vs single call.** The Static Maps API caps a single image at 640×640 base × 2 scale = 1280×1280 effective pixels. For typical garden-sized bboxes (≤ ~200 m on a side at high latitudes) one call is enough; for larger areas `google_maps_service.fetch_bbox` falls back to a 2×2 or 3×3 mosaic at the highest zoom that fits the configured `_MAX_GRID = 3` budget (`pick_zoom_and_grid`). Resulting image is stitched with Pillow before reaching the canvas as a single `BackgroundImageItem`.

**Pixel→meter scale is analytical.** Because Static Maps uses Web-Mercator with a known tile pixel size, the scale of the returned image is `mpp = cos(lat) × 2π × 6378137 / (256 × 2^zoom)`. The new `BackgroundImageItem(geo_metadata=…)` constructor reads `meters_per_pixel` from this dict and sets `_scale_factor = 0.01 / mpp` (px-per-cm) automatically — no calibration click. The existing manual calibration (`Calibrate Scale…` context menu) is still available as an override; on reload, a saved `scale_factor` wins over the geo-derived one.

### 8.15.1 Manual background-image calibration and exact dimensions

Manual calibration is available on the imported image itself, not on the
empty canvas. After importing an image, right-click the image and choose
**Calibrate Scale…**. Click the two endpoints of a feature whose real distance
is known, enter that distance in centimetres, and press **Enter** to apply the
scale. Press **Esc** to cancel the inline calibration instead.

For exact geometry, use the numeric fields in the **Properties** panel:

- rectangles: **Size (W/H)**;
- circles: **Diameter**;
- ellipses: **Semi-axes X** and **Y** (the corresponding width and height are
  twice those values).

Polygons and polylines currently do not have an overall numeric width/height
editor. For those shapes, use typed coordinates or edge-length constraints
when precision matters. These workflows complement manual image calibration:
calibrate the background first, then enter exact geometry values or constrain
the relevant edges.

**QtWebEngine import timing.** `from PyQt6 import QtWebEngineWidgets` must run *before* `QApplication(...)` is created — Qt enforces this so it can configure OpenGL sharing. `main.py` does this at module level. Tests that exercise the dialog must either match the same ordering or use a `QWidget` stand-in for `QWebEngineView` (see `tests/integration/test_map_picker_dialog.py::_DummyWebView`).


## 8.16 Typed Coordinate Input + Unified Snap Engine (Package A — ADRs 020 + 021)

This concept covers four user stories that ship together in Phase 13: relative input `@dx,dy`, polar input `@dist<angle`, midpoint + intersection snap, and the Dynamic Input cursor overlay. The architecture decisions live in **ADR-020** (snap engine) and **ADR-021** (input pipeline); this section captures the cross-cutting *rules* a developer must follow when extending either system.

### 8.16.1 Snap engine layering

* `core/snap/` is the orchestration layer. It does **not** own any geometry — every provider delegates to `measure_snapper.get_anchor_points` or to `core/snap/geometry.item_edges`. Do not duplicate point enumeration; if a new anchor type is needed, add it to `AnchorType` first and a provider second.
* Every provider has a `priority`. Lower wins on ties. Defaults: endpoint 10, intersection 15, center 20, midpoint 30, edge 40. When tuning, remember that two candidates within sub-pixel distance frequently exist (e.g. a corner is also two edge endpoints).
* The `QuadTree` is rebuilt lazily by `CanvasView._ensure_snap_index()` on the first snap query after `QGraphicsScene.changed` fires. Do **not** rebuild eagerly on every signal — for thousand-item gardens the build cost (~3 ms) dominates if you do.
* Items spanning multiple quadrants are inserted into every overlapping child rather than parked at the parent; `_query` collects them via an `id()` set so duplicates never surface. Keep this in mind when changing `_insert_into_children` — switching to a "store at parent" strategy is also valid but must be paired with removing the dedup set.
* `PointSnapper.snap()` widens the query window to `4 × threshold` so that intersection candidates from edges starting outside the cursor area still surface. If you raise the threshold drastically, also revisit `MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_QUERY = 60` in `providers/intersection.py` — the O(n²) intersection step is the soft ceiling.

### 8.16.2 Drawing-tool integration

* `CanvasView._maybe_apply_anchor_snap(tool, scene_pos)` is the single entry point. It runs *before* the tool's `mouse_press/move/release`. Tools that own their anchor logic — `SelectTool`, `MeasureTool`, every `ConstraintTool` family member — set `BaseTool.skip_anchor_snap = True` to opt out (the previous string-prefix match on `tool_type.name` is gone). When adding a new tool that does its own anchor picking, set the flag; otherwise leave it `False` and the dispatcher will apply Package A point snap automatically.
* **Composition rule with grid snap**: `CanvasView.snap_point()` short-circuits the grid-rounding step when `_current_snap is not None`, so an anchor-snap match always wins over grid snap on the click path. Tools may still call `view.snap_point(scene_pos)` defensively — when the dispatcher matched a midpoint/intersection/endpoint, that call is a no-op apart from the canvas-bounds clamp. Do NOT short-circuit the snap inside the tool: the dispatcher is the single owner of this decision.
* The current snap candidate is rendered by `_draw_point_snap_glyph` in `drawForeground`. Glyph mapping is intentionally pictographic and lives in one switch: square = endpoint, circle = center, triangle = midpoint, X = intersection, dot = edge. Add a new kind by extending `SnapCandidateKind` *and* `_draw_point_snap_glyph`; reviewers will reject a half-done mapping.

### 8.16.3 Typed-input invariants

* There is exactly **one** `CoordinateInputBuffer` per `CanvasView`. Both the status-bar field and the Dynamic Input overlay subscribe to its signals; they must never own buffer state of their own. If you add a third surface (e.g. a command palette), wire it the same way.
* The buffer's `anchor` is refreshed by `CanvasView.refresh_input_anchor()`. It is called after every `set_active_tool`, `mouse_press`, `mouse_release`, `mouse_double_click` and `key_press`. Add a new lifecycle hook? Add the refresh call.
* The Y-flip lives **only** in `parser.py`. The user-entered Y is math-positive (up); the parser converts to scene Y (down). Adding a second flip site elsewhere will break relative input in subtle, locale-specific ways.
* The smart decimal/separator rules (A–F) in the parser docstring are not negotiable per call site — they are global. When extending the grammar (e.g. a future `@3,4@2` array-along-path syntax), add a new rule **before** D and write a regression test that covers the same ambiguous input under both old and new rules.

### 8.16.4 Adding typed-coordinate support to a new drawing tool

Three steps, no more:

1. Override `last_point` to return the current anchor (`None` outside an active draw sequence).
2. Override `commit_typed_coordinate(point)` to perform the same action a left click at `point` would, **without** re-applying grid snap (the user has typed exact coords).
3. If the tool finalises on the second click (rectangle/circle/ellipse pattern), call `_reset_state()` and return `True` from `commit_typed_coordinate` after finalisation so `last_point` becomes `None` again.

The integration tests in `tests/unit/test_tool_typed_input.py` cover this contract; a new tool must add a similar parametrised test case.

### 8.16.5 Dynamic Input overlay visibility — three hard rules

The floating overlay is *visible* only when **all** of:

1. `dynamic_input_enabled` is True (View menu / settings).
2. The active tool exists and is not SELECT.
3. The tool's `last_point` is **not** `None` (no anchor → no polar/relative makes sense).

Any other state must hide the overlay. The implementation lives in `CanvasView._update_dynamic_overlay`. If you add a new hide-condition, do it there; do not add visibility logic inside the overlay widget itself — it has no knowledge of the active tool by design.

## 8.17 Sidebar Accordion — Hover-Peek + Click-to-Toggle (ADR-030, issue #226)

The right sidebar is an accordion owned by `SidebarController` (`ui/widgets/panel_stack.py`). It is the single source of truth for every panel's state; `CollapsiblePanel` is a dumb show/hide-and-tween primitive underneath it.

> The first cut used a bottom `QSplitter` that pinned panels *reparented* into (equal-share, draggable). It failed manual testing — opening a panel made it jump to the bottom (reorder), there was no animation, and selection-opened panels were unclosable. This section documents the **revised** model (ADR-030 addendum): one scrollable layout, no reparenting, animated, click-toggles.

### 8.17.1 The state machine

Each panel is `COLLAPSED`, `PEEKING`, or `PINNED`, with a `PinSource` of `USER` or `SELECTION` when open:

- **COLLAPSED** — content hidden; `setMinimumHeight(0)` **then** `setMaximumHeight(header_height())`. Reset the minimum *before* clamping the max.
- **PEEKING** — hover-opened (auto-collapses on leave); content grows to its size.
- **PINNED** — click- or selection-opened; stays open until the title is clicked again. `USER` (click) survives a selection clear; `SELECTION` (auto) is collapsed when the selection no longer matches.

`is_open(key)` ⇔ state ∈ {PEEKING, PINNED}. Clicking the title of **any** open panel collapses it (see §8.17.5).

### 8.17.2 Layout: one scrollable stack, no reparenting

```
SidebarController → QVBoxLayout
  └── QScrollArea (setWidgetResizable, h-scrollbar off)
        └── inner QWidget → QVBoxLayout(spacing 2)
              ├── CollapsiblePanel × 9   # ALWAYS here, fixed canonical order
              └── addStretch()           # last; keeps bars top-aligned when short
```

**Panels are never reparented** — a state change only adjusts the panel's height clamp, so opening/closing one can never reorder the list (the reported bug). There is no splitter and no draggable divider.

**Open panels fill the surplus space.** An open panel's floor is its content height (`setMinimumHeight(sizeHint)`, set on open) and it carries a **content-weighted layout stretch factor** (`setStretchFactor(panel, sizeHint().height())`); collapsed panels have stretch 0 and are clamped to the header. So:
- One panel open → it absorbs all the surplus and fills the sidebar (no empty gap at the bottom — the reported polish item). A panel with an internal scroll area (e.g. Plant Details) thus reveals more of its content.
- Several open → each gets at least its content height, and the leftover surplus is shared **weighted by content size** (the panel with more to show gets proportionally more, instead of an equal half a light panel can't fill).
- Combined content exceeds the viewport → the `QScrollArea` scrolls (the minimum heights force the inner widget past the viewport; the trailing `addStretch()` contributes 0 height, so scroll engages) and each panel sits at its content height.

The stretch is set **after** the content is revealed (`set_expanded(True)` first) so `sizeHint()` reflects the content, not the header-only collapsed height. The minimum is set only **after** the open animation finishes (during the tween it stays 0, else a min above the animating `maximumHeight` would jump the panel).

### 8.17.3 Animation (organic expand/collapse)

Each panel owns a lazy `QPropertyAnimation` on `maximumHeight` (`CollapsiblePanel.animate_expand`/`animate_collapse`, ~160 ms `InOutCubic`):
- **Expand**: `set_expanded(True)` first so the content is visible and `sizeHint()` is valid, then tween the clamp `header → sizeHint`; on finish release the clamp to `QWIDGETSIZE_MAX` so the panel tracks later content-size changes (e.g. a list populating after `update_for_plant`).
- **Collapse**: flip the chevron + logical state immediately (responsive, and keeps `is_expanded()` correct for tests/state), keep the content widget *visible* during the shrink so it is drawn clipped, tween `height → header`, and hide the content on finish.
- `_restart_anim` stops any running tween and reconnects a fresh `finished` handler, so rapid open↔close toggles are safe. `expand_now`/`collapse_now` are the non-animated variants used at startup and `collapse_all()`.

### 8.17.4 Debounce + anti-flicker (hover-peek)

Two controller-level single-shot timers — open (~140 ms) and close (~220 ms, longer so a fast diagonal sweep to the canvas doesn't cascade-peek). The pointer leaves only one bar at a time, so a single `_pending_open_key` / `_pending_close_key` suffices; re-entering a bar cancels its pending close. `PINNED` panels ignore hover. Timer slots re-fetch the entry via `.get(key)` and bail on `None`; `start()`/`stop()` are wrapped in `contextlib.suppress(RuntimeError)` (teardown-safe).

> **Deliberate sharp edge:** the content widget is a *sibling* of `_HeaderFrame`, not a child, so moving the pointer from the header down into a peeked panel's body fires the header's `leaveEvent` and schedules the close — a peek can collapse while the pointer is over its content. This is intentional: peek is transient (the tooltip says "Click to keep open", and a click pins it), and the asymmetric debounce is tuned for the sweep-to-canvas case. Do **not** "fix" it by widening the hover region to include the body — that would break the fast-sweep behaviour.

### 8.17.5 Click-toggle + selection dismissal

`_on_title_click`:
- **PINNED** → collapse. If it was `SELECTION`-opened, set `selection_dismissed = True` so it does **not** re-open on the next selection *re-notify* (a scene move / undo fires `set_selection_pinned(True)` again for the same selection).
- **PEEKING** → promote the hover-peek to a sticky `USER` pin (already open).
- **COLLAPSED** → open as a `USER` pin.

`set_selection_pinned(key, True)` opens as `SELECTION` *unless* `selection_dismissed`. `reset_selection_dismissals()` clears all dismissals and is called from `application._on_selection_changed` (wired to `selectionChanged` **before** the `_update_*_panel` slots), so a genuine selection change re-opens the contextual panels for the newly selected item. When wiring a selection signal to a contextual panel, keep the panel's own content-update call (`set_selected_items` / `update_for_plant` / `update_for_bed`), then call `set_panel_visible(key, relevant)` **and** `set_selection_pinned(key, relevant)`.

### 8.17.6a Contextual-panel visibility

Plant Details / Companion / Crop Rotation have nothing to show unless a matching item is selected, so their **bar is hidden entirely** when irrelevant (they are NOT left as empty collapsed bars the user could open onto a placeholder — this restores the pre-US-226 `setVisible(False)` behaviour). `set_panel_visible(key, visible)` is **orthogonal** to open/collapse: hiding (`visible=False`) cancels any pending hover, collapses the panel instantly (so it reopens clean) and `setVisible(False)`s it (a hidden widget takes no layout space); showing re-adds the bar. The three panels are hidden at startup in `_setup_sidebar` and toggled by the selection updaters via `show_panel`. Non-contextual panels are never hidden. `_fill_target` and the surplus share ignore hidden panels (they occupy no space).

### 8.17.6 The dynamic-property QSS gotcha

`set_visual_state(state)` sets a `panelState` dynamic property (`collapsed`/`peeking`/`pinned`) — but Qt does **not** re-evaluate property selectors until you `style().unpolish(w); style().polish(w)`. The header is styled via `CollapsiblePanel[panelState=…] > QFrame`, so **both** the panel and its header must be re-polished (re-polishing only the parent leaves the child header stale). Peeking = accent border; pinned = 3 px left accent rail; collapsed has a cheap `:hover` highlight for instant affordance before the peek debounce commits.

### 8.17.7 No persistence

Startup is always fully collapsed; pin/peek/dismissal state is never saved. The `UiStateStore` panel-state helpers were removed (window geometry + the horizontal `main` splitter are still persisted).

## 8.18 Smart Symbol Authoring (US-C4)

Smart symbols are **parametric blocks** defined in JSON. Bundled definitions
live in `resources/data/smart_symbols/*.json`; users add their own by dropping a
file in `<app-data>/smart_symbols/` (it appears in the **Smart Symbols** panel on
next launch). See ADR-032 for the architecture.

**File shape** (one symbol per file; `id` should match the filename):

```json

    {"repeat": {"var": "i", "from": 1, "to": "rows - 1"},
     "element": {"kind": "line", "x1": 0, "y1": "W * i / rows", "x2": "L", "y2": "W * i / rows"}}
  ]
}
```

- **Parameters** — `type` is `number` (integer spin), `length` (float spin, with
  optional `unit`), or `choice` (`choices: [...]`, combo). `name`/`name_de` and
  per-param `label`/`label_de` provide localisation (German falls back to
  English); these are **data strings**, not Qt `tr()`.
- **Elements** — `kind` ∈ `rect{x,y,w,h}`, `line{x1,y1,x2,y2}`,
  `polyline{points:[[x,y],…]}`, `polygon{points}`, `circle{cx,cy,r}`. Every
  coordinate is a number **or** an arithmetic **expression string** over the
  parameters (and the active `repeat` variable `i`). A `repeat{var,from,to}`
  block (inclusive integer range; endpoints may be expressions) emits its inner
  `element` once per value.
- **Expressions** are evaluated by `core/parametric_eval.safe_eval` — `+ - * / %
  ** //`, parentheses, parameter names, and `min/max/abs/round/floor/ceil/sqrt`.
  Anything else (attribute access, arbitrary calls, unknown names) is rejected:
  symbol files are treated as untrusted input, never `eval()`'d. All param values
  are coerced to **float**, so a parameter cannot be used as the `ndigits` arg of
  `round(x, n)` (that needs an int — `round(x, rows)` raises and the symbol falls
  back to cached geometry). Keep expressions small: an over-complex or deeply
  nested formula is rejected (a node-count cap guards against stack-exhausting
  input); coordinate formulas are a few terms, not a program.
- **Versioning** — bump `version` when a definition changes incompatibly. A
  saved plan stores the instance's `version`; on load, a mismatch (or a missing
  definition) falls back to the cached geometry embedded in the file and logs a
  warning, so old plans never break.

`tests/unit/test_smart_symbol_schema.py` validates every bundled file in CI
(loads, validates, every expression parses, generates ≥1 primitive).

## 8.19 Agent API — Embedded MCP Server & Thread Marshaling (US-D1.1–D1.6, D2.0–D2.6, D3.1–D3.4, ADR-033/034/035/036)

The app can host an **MCP server over streamable-HTTP** so AI agents read the
plan currently open in the GUI and, behind the D2 write gate, edit it (epic
#237). Package: `agent_api/`
(`bridge.py`, `server.py`, `schema.py`, `mapping.py`, `queries.py`,
`diagnostics.py`, `prompts.py`, `creates.py`, `edits.py`, `render.py`, `exports.py`,
`providers.py`, `__init__.py`).

**Lifecycle.** `AgentApiServer` builds a `FastMCP`, takes its
`streamable_http_app()` ASGI app, and runs a `uvicorn.Server` we own on a
**daemon `threading.Thread`** with its own asyncio loop. `start()` pre-binds the
port (precise `PortInUseError`) then polls `server.started`; `stop()` sets
`should_exit` and joins. **On by default** (`AppSettings.agent_api_enabled`
default **True**, `agent_api_port` default 8765; a Preferences toggle disables
it), **auto-starts on launch**, bound to **127.0.0.1 only**. Wired in `application.py`:
`_setup_agent_api` (deferred auto-start) / `_on_preferences` (live restart on
toggle/port change) / `closeEvent` (stop).

**Thread-marshaling boundary (`MainThreadBridge`).** Tool handlers run on the
server thread and must never touch Qt directly. `run_on_main(fn)` emits a
`QueuedConnection` signal carrying `(fn, Future)`; the slot runs `fn` on the main
thread and resolves the future; the worker blocks on `future.result(timeout)`.
This is the reusable, write-ready core (D2 edit tools route through it the same
way reads do).

**Pitfall — sync vs async tool dispatch (verified mcp 1.28.1).** The SDK runs a
**sync** tool handler *inline on the event loop*; only `async` handlers yield it.
So a Qt-touching tool MUST be `async def` and offload the blocking main-thread hop
to a worker: `await anyio.to_thread.run_sync(snapshot_provider)`. A sync handler
calling `run_on_main` would block the uvicorn loop on `future.result()`.

**Pitfall — shutdown deadlock.** During `closeEvent` the main thread stops pumping
the Qt loop (it's in `stop()`'s `join`), so an in-flight `run_on_main` could hang.
`MainThreadBridge.abort_pending()` (called *before* `server.stop()`) fails any
in-flight hop immediately so the handler returns and the join completes fast.

**Read model (ADR-034).** Reads go through `ProjectManager.snapshot_dict()` — an
in-memory, read-only `.ogp`-shaped dict (it does NOT run the journal-pin sync that
`save()` does, so reading never mutates state). The Qt-free `mapping.py` maps it to
the curated pydantic `schema.py` (`PlanSummary`); object classification inlines the
bed/plant `ObjectType` name sets, drift-guarded by `tests/unit/test_agent_api_mapping.py`.

**Read/query tools (US-D1.2).** `build_server`/`AgentApiServer` take an
`AgentProviders` bundle (Qt-free) of main-thread-marshaled callables (`snapshot`,
`diagnostics`) — the extension seam for render/export/write later. Tools:
- **Structural/spatial** — `list_objects`, `get_object`, `objects_in_region`,
  `objects_in`, `plants_in_bed`, `nearest_objects`, `measure_distance` are pure
  functions over the snapshot (`agent_api/queries.py`, Qt-free, **linear scan** not
  the live quadtree). Coordinates are the **native scene frame** (cm, CAD Y-up per
  ADR-002: origin bottom-left, +y north/up); shapes are summarised by `object_bbox` (handles every
  serialised geometry). `raw=True` returns the serialiser dict(s) via a **dict-first
  union return** (`list[dict] | list[ObjectRef]`) so FastMCP keeps a clean `anyOf`
  schema **and** preserves unknown keys on raw (model-first would coerce raw dicts
  back into the model and drop keys — verified mcp 1.28.1).
- **`get_diagnostics`** reports the plan's **already-computed** warnings, not a
  recomputation: `ProjectManager.diagnostics_snapshot` harvests each garden item's
  badge flags (`antagonist_warning` / `spacing_overlap` / `capacity_overrun` /
  `soil_mismatch_level` / `rotation_status`) on the main thread into Qt-free records,
  and the Qt-free `diagnostics.py` maps them to `Diagnostic`. Positive indicators
  (spacing `"ideal"`, rotation `"good"`) are not reported; values reflect the last
  computed badge state (may lag a debounce tick — fine for read-only inspection).
  The one exception is `outside_canvas` (#380): it is not a badge flag but is
  computed on every call from each item's live `sceneBoundingRect()`.

**Vision tool (US-D1.3).** `render_canvas_image(x?, y?, width?, height?, layers?,
image_width_px?)` returns a PNG of the live canvas plus a `RenderMeta` block,
reusing `services/scene_rendering.render_scene_region` — the exact pipeline
`ExportService.export_to_png`/the PDF report already use, no new rendering
logic. `agent_api/render.py` is the one Qt-**touching** module in the package
(says so in its own docstring): `resolve_image_pixel_size` (pure, no Qt) clamps
the requested width **and** the aspect-ratio-derived height independently to
`[128, 2048]` so a pathological region can't produce a runaway image; the
provider resolves the default region (full canvas), temporarily forces
layer-bearing item visibility to match `layers` (`_hidden_layers_not_in` —
a full override of what's shown, not a subtractive filter, so an allowed
layer the user has toggled off live is shown anyway; restores every item's
*original* visibility afterward), renders, and PNG-encodes — all in **one**
atomic main-thread hop (`AgentProviders.render`, the first *parametrized*
provider). Two things were **empirically verified**, not assumed:
- `Image` (from `mcp.server.fastmcp.utilities.types`) isn't pydantic-representable,
  so the natural `-> list[Image | RenderMeta]` annotation crashes `build_server()`
  at decoration time; `@mcp.tool(structured_output=False)` is the verified fix,
  at the cost of this one tool having no `structuredContent` (parse the
  `TextContent` block's JSON instead). Relatedly: with `from __future__ import
  annotations` in effect, `Image` must be a genuine module-level import in
  `server.py` — importing it only inside `build_server()` (as `FastMCP` is)
  raises `NameError` at server-build time, since FastMCP resolves stringified
  annotations via the function's own `__globals__`, not the enclosing call's
  locals.
- The rendered image's pixel Y-axis is **inverted** relative to the D1.2 scene
  frame — `render_scene_region`'s `y_flip=True` (kept for parity with the live
  CAD view and every other export) means a small scene-y lands near the
  **bottom** of the image, not the top. Pinned by rendering a known-position
  item and scanning actual pixels (`tests/unit/test_agent_api_render_coordinate_frame.py`).
  The correction formula is documented on `RenderMeta.px_per_cm`:
  `px_x = (x_cm - region_x_cm) * px_per_cm`;
  `px_y = image_height_px - (y_cm - region_y_cm) * px_per_cm`.

See ADR-034 addendum (US-D1.3) for the full reasoning.

**Export/save tools (US-D1.4).** `save_plan(file_path?)`, `export_pdf(file_path?,
paper_size?, orientation?)`, `export_dxf(file_path?)`, and `export_csv(kind,
file_path?)` are the first Agent API tools with a **filesystem side effect**
beyond returning bytes/dicts — each writes a real file to disk by calling the
exact same services the GUI's File > Export/Save menu already calls
(`PdfReportService`, `DxfExportService`, `ExportService`, `ShoppingListService`,
`ProjectManager.save`). `agent_api/exports.py::resolve_export_path` is the
shared path-resolution helper: with no `file_path`, it uses the same
`app/paths.py` chokepoint the GUI dialogs use (`default_save_path`/
`default_dialog_dir`, the #199/#204 data-loss fix — next to the currently open
project, or `<Documents>/Open Garden Planner`); with an explicit `file_path`,
it force-applies the correct suffix and requires the parent directory already
exist (a typo'd path fails clearly rather than silently creating a directory
tree). `save_plan` with no `file_path` and no project open raises rather than
inventing an `Untitled.ogp` — mirrors the GUI, where a brand-new project always
needs an explicit Save-As first; given a path, it becomes the project's file
going forward (Save As semantics), and `ExportResult.previous_file_path` reports
the prior file so a caller can tell whether the call redirected the project.
None of these tools return `Image`, so D1.3's `structured_output=False`
workaround doesn't apply — all four register normally and share one
`ExportResult` schema. **No token auth needed:** these tools don't mutate the
in-memory plan (`save_plan` persists what's already on screen, mirroring
`application._save_to_file` including its issue-#178 stale-price prune); the
token-auth gate stays reserved for D2's scene-mutating write tools (ADR-033).
None of the four are overwrite-safe the way a `QFileDialog` prompt is — an
explicit path pointing at an unrelated file is overwritten without
confirmation, accepted under the loopback-trust model. See ADR-034 addendum
(US-D1.4) for the full reasoning.

**Resources & prompts (US-D1.5).** Five read-only resources — `garden://plan`
(curated `PlanSummary`), `garden://plan/raw` (uncurated snapshot dict),
`garden://canvas.png` (full-canvas PNG, no region/layer args), `garden://
diagnostics`, `garden://species` (bundled species DB, 118 records) — and two
read-analysis prompts, `audit-plan` and `describe-garden` (new Qt-free
`agent_api/prompts.py`), round out the epic's "tools + resources + prompts"
MCP surface. Four of the five resources are one-line reuses of existing
D1.2–D1.4 functions; `garden://species` calls `services/bundled_species_db
.get_species_db()` directly with **no `AgentProviders` field and no
main-thread hop** — that module is Qt-free static bundled data, not live-plan
state. Verified directly against the installed `mcp==1.28.1` source (not
assumed, same discipline as D1.3's `Image` discovery): resource functions are
simpler than tools — `@mcp.resource(uri)` only inspects params via plain
`inspect.signature(fn)` (every D1.5 resource is zero-argument, so the
tool-only `eval_str`/module-level-import gotcha doesn't apply), a `bytes`
return with an explicit `mime_type` produces a base64-encoded
`BlobResourceContents` automatically (**no** `Image`/`structured_output=False`
workaround — that was tool-dispatch-only), and any other return (a pydantic
model, a `dict`, a `list`) auto-serializes via `pydantic_core.to_json`. A
plain `str` prompt return is likewise wrapped into a `UserMessage`
automatically. See ADR-034 addendum (US-D1.5) for the full reasoning.

**AI client onboarding (US-D1.6).** A running server is useless until the
user's AI client knows its URL — there's no universal localhost-MCP
auto-discovery. The Help → "Connect AI Assistant…" dialog
(`ConnectAiAssistantDialog`) and a new Qt-free `services/ai_client_onboarding
.py` close that gap: `detect_clients()` checks each client's known config
location (`~/.cursor`, `claude` on `PATH` / `~/.claude.json`, the platform
Claude Desktop app-data dir), and `install_to_client()` registers the URL
where each client's own docs support a safe automatic path — **Cursor** via a
direct JSON merge into `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, **Claude Code** via the `claude
mcp add --transport http --scope user` CLI when it's on `PATH`, else a
**direct atomic merge into the top-level `mcpServers` of `~/.claude.json`**
(the same user-scope `type: "http"` entry the CLI writes, read by both the
CLI and the VS Code extension — so onboarding works without a terminal; the
merge fails *closed* on an unreadable file, since `~/.claude.json` also holds
OAuth/trust). **Claude Desktop is detection-only and cannot reach a localhost
server** (its connectors are reached from Anthropic's cloud and reject
`localhost`), so its row shows an honest "use Claude Code or Cursor instead"
note — no button, no snippet. Every client with an automatic path also gets a
copy-paste JSON snippet with a short "where to put this" note, and an always-
present vendor-agnostic group (canonical `mcpServers` JSON + generic CLI shape +
bare URL) covers any client OGP has never heard of. This is the **first
atomic-write pattern in the codebase**: every prior JSON writer here only
ever wrote its own file with a bare `open(path, "w")`; because this one edits
files *owned by other applications*, the merge preserves every other
key/server and writes via a same-directory temp file + `os.replace()`, copying
the file's current contents to `<name>.bak` **immediately before** that write
and naming the backup in its success message. Two consequences of the ordering:
a **refused** merge leaves the directory byte- and file-for-file identical (a
refusal is the common case for a `foreign` target, so taking the backup earlier
meant the common case littered a second file beside a config OGP had just
declined to touch), and a second call overwrites `.bak` with the state from just
before *that* call, not the pristine original.

**Generalized in issue #366 — clients are data, and the writer is keyed on syntax
rather than on client.** A client is one frozen `ClientTarget` in `TARGETS`;
`container_key` (possibly dotted, e.g. `mcp.servers`), `syntax`
(`json`/`jsonc`/`toml`) and `entry`/`cli_argv` are independent fields, so a new
client is one record rather than two new `if`/`elif` branches, and the dialog
needed no change to gain OpenCode, Codex and Gemini CLI. The three
client-agnostic guarantees (backup, atomic replace, fail-closed) now exist once
in `_merge_into_config`, with only serialisation varying per syntax. Three
lessons worth carrying: **(a)** a client's config may be a *superset* of the
format you assume (OpenCode's is commented JSON that plain `json.load()`
rejects) — and a fail-closed rule is only safe while the *read* can understand
what it refuses to clobber; the tolerant reader is a character scan, not a
regex, and the strict reader still raises so leniency cannot leak into
fail-closed. **(b)** A surgical writer into a file you don't own owes a **parse
check on its own output** — validating the input is not a licence to write an
unverified result (a header spelled `["mcp_servers"."name"]`, or a `[`-leading
line inside another table's multi-line string, both produce a file the user's
own program cannot parse, and one of them destroys the other table's data).
**(c)** Never re-serialise a file you do not own: that is why TOML is appended
surgically and why the foreign JSONC target *refuses* the merge rather than
rewriting the user's comments away. See ADR-035 (with its #253 and #366
addenda) for the per-client reasoning and §11.4 for the pitfall entries.

**Agent write path & token gate (US-D2.0/D2.1, ADR-036).** The scene-mutating
tools — `move_object(item_id, dx, dy)`, `delete_object(item_id)` (D2.0) and
`create_object(object_type, x, y, …)` (D2.1) — sit
behind **two independent guards**: a **writes-enabled** Settings toggle
(`agent_api_writes_enabled`, **default OFF**) and a **bearer token**
(`agent_api_token`, auto-generated with `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`). The tools
are **registered only when both are present** (`writes_enabled and write_token`)
— when either is missing they don't appear in the tool list at all — and each
call must carry the token, **either in the connect URL as a `?token=` query
param or as an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header** (the URL token wins when
both are present, so a stale legacy header can't shadow it). The URL route is the reliable one: Claude Code on streamable-HTTP
stores a configured header but omits it on tool-call requests (anthropics/
claude-code#50464 / #28293), while the URL — being the request target — is
always transmitted; delivering the secret there preserves the same threat model
(a caller still needs the token) at the cost of a URL-borne secret (mitigated:
uvicorn access log off + the `token` param is stripped from the request scope
right after extraction, so nothing downstream logs it). Reads stay open (loopback
trust, unchanged), so the gate is **per-tool, not a server-wide middleware**
that would break read-only D1 clients: a pure-ASGI wrapper
(`_bearer_token_middleware`) reads each request's token from the header or the
`?token=` query string into a `contextvars.ContextVar`, and each write handler
calls `_require_write_auth` (constant-time `secrets.compare_digest`) in the same
request task, **before** the `anyio.to_thread.run_sync` main-thread hop. Verified end-to-end against
`mcp==1.28.1` with `stateless_http=True` that the ContextVar set in middleware
is visible in the tool handler for the same request (chosen over a `ctx:
Context` header read so the gate doesn't depend on FastMCP internals). The
write itself hops to the main thread via an `AgentProviders` callable,
resolves the item by UUID (`scene.find_item_by_id`), and runs
`canvas_view.command_manager.execute(cmd)` — matching GUI *behaviour*, not
merely reusing a `Command` class: `delete_object` mirrors
`CanvasView._delete_selected_items`'s full orchestration, not just
`DeleteItemsCommand` — it also removes any constraint referencing the object
(`RemoveConstraintCommand`, else the constraint graph keeps a dangling UUID)
and deletes a `HOUSE`'s linked roof ridge (a `metadata["ridge_item_id"]`
association, else orphaned); contained plants are still detached, not
deleted, matching the GUI's "Keep plants" choice. `move_object` mirrors
`CanvasView`'s whole drag-release sequence — a bed/container/trellis's
contained plants move with it (`AlignItemsCommand` over item+children), and a
moved plant's bed membership is re-evaluated afterward (`SetParentBedCommand`
on a boundary crossing) — so **one agent write is one undoable step for a lone
item, and two when a move also reparents a plant**, never more; every command
still marks the plan dirty (invariants #3/#4/#13; no parallel mutation path).
Both tools **refuse** (in the shared `_resolve_agent_item` chokepoint, so
future write tools inherit it) rather than silently mishandle cases the agent
could otherwise reach by resolving a UUID directly but the GUI forbids: an
object (or, for `move_object`, a bed child) in a geometric constraint —
`CanvasView`'s live solver computes per-item deltas a one-shot agent call
doesn't replicate; a journal pin, whose delete needs a `ProjectData`
note-record prune no bare `DeleteItemsCommand` performs; an item on a **locked
layer** (the GUI enforces the lock by clearing `ItemIsSelectable`/
`ItemIsMovable`, which selection-based GUI edits respect but a UUID lookup
bypasses); and an individual **group member** (a raw snapshot exposes its id,
but `moveBy` on a `QGraphicsItemGroup` child displaces it within the group —
address the group itself). `GroupItem`/`SmartSymbolItem` moves need no special
handling: they are real Qt groups, so `moveBy`/delete cascade to members
natively (the bed↔plant link is *logical*, which is why beds don't).

**Creation is the exception to that chokepoint (US-D2.1).** `create_object`
has no existing item to resolve, so it inherits **none** of
`_resolve_agent_item`'s four refusals — which makes it the one write tool whose
guards have to be stated separately. They live in two places, deliberately, and
must be kept in step:

- **Shape, size and position** — the Qt-free `agent_api/creates.py`. Beyond the
  obvious (unsupported type, a dimension that doesn't fit the shape, a missing
  or non-positive or non-finite extent) it applies two **sanity bounds**, because
  finite-and-positive is not the same as plausible and an agent is exactly where
  a metres-for-centimetres slip appears: every extent is capped at twice the
  plan's larger canvas dimension (the error names the real plan size), and a
  **plant's** diameter is additionally capped at 5000 cm because a plant
  footprint feeds `plant_renderer.render_plant_pixmap`, which allocates an
  `int(diameter)`-square ARGB `QImage` **from scene centimetres, not device
  pixels**, on the Qt main thread — quadratic, and measured at ~2.3 GB / ~3 s
  for a 24000 cm diameter, with allocation failure yielding a *null* (not
  `None`) `QPixmap` the paint path forwards unchecked. Positions further than
  one canvas beyond an edge are refused too: such an object is invisible,
  unselectable and un-deletable in the GUI, so reporting success would be a lie.
  This mirrors `render.py`'s existing precedent of clamping agent-supplied
  sizes harder than the GUI does.
- **Scene state** — `GardenPlannerApp._agent_creation_target_layer()`, which
  needs the live scene and so cannot be Qt-free. It refuses a **locked active
  layer** (the creation-side counterpart of the item-side lock check) and
  returns `None` when the scene has no active layer at all, matching the GUI
  drop path, which likewise leaves `layer_id` unset. It exists as a named seam
  rather than an inline check so the next creation-shaped tool inherits it.

One further asymmetry is worth knowing: creating on a **hidden** active layer
silently un-hides that layer (`QGraphicsScene.addItem` does this for the GUI's
draw tools too) and **undo does not re-hide it** — so the operation is one undo
*stack* entry while leaving a non-undoable visibility change. Pre-existing GUI
behaviour, not a D2.1 regression, but it sits oddly beside the locked-layer
refusal and is recorded in FR-AGENT-14.

Unlike `move_object`, `create_object` needs no bed reconciliation:
`CreateItemCommand.execute` already calls `_auto_parent_plant` and its `undo`
calls `_detach_from_parent`, so a new plant's bed link is established and
reversed **inside the single create step**. (The first cut of D2.1 added an
explicit reconcile on the false premise that the GUI never links a dropped
plant; a probe of the running code disproved it — see ADR-036's D2.1 addendum.)

The token is surfaced (Copy/Regenerate) in Preferences → Agent API and
injected into each client's config by the D1.6 onboarding writers as a
`?token=` query param on the connect URL (`ai_client_onboarding.url_with_token`).
See ADR-036 (and its URL-delivery addendum); §8.11 for the security note.

**Editing existing objects (US-D2.2/D2.3).** Four more tools sit inside the same
`if writes_active:` block and share `_resolve_agent_item`: `resize_object`,
`rotate_object`, `set_species`, `set_parent_bed`. Each applies exactly one
undoable command; none reparents, so none produces the second undo step
`move_object` can. Three points are load-bearing for anyone extending them:

* **One geometry-apply path per geometry model.** `ResizeItemCommand` /
  `RotateItemCommand` take a caller-supplied `apply_func`, and before D2.2 every
  call site had its own closure — which had drifted, leaving three rotated-geometry
  bugs in shipped GUI paths (§11.4). `ui/canvas/geometry_apply.py` is now the single
  implementation; **its module docstring is the authoritative list of callers and of
  the two deliberate exceptions**, and is deliberately not restated here. Do not add
  another rect closure; add a builder there.
* **Centre-preserving is the agent's anchor rule, for every type.** The read
  tools and `create_object` speak in centres, so `resize_object` holds the
  scene centre invariant; the panel keeps its own per-type anchor behaviour.
  Both are the same builder with `keep_center=True|False`, and both solve `pos`
  through `anchored_position()` so a rotated item lands correctly either way.
* **Rotation sign is measured, not assumed.** A positive angle is
  **counter-clockwise** (east-pointing → north after `+90`). Pinned against a
  measured corner position in both `tests/unit/test_agent_api_edits.py` and
  `tests/integration/test_agent_api_default_on.py` — never against the stored
  angle, which cannot detect an inverted convention. This is the #267 lesson
  applied prospectively.

`set_species` delegates to `ui/plant_species_assignment.apply_species_to_item`
(the #213 helper the plant panel and species search already share) rather than
building `ApplySpeciesCommand` itself; its `apply_database_size` flag answers
the GUI's conflicting-override dialog and is **not** a general "skip the resize"
switch. `set_parent_bed` changes the link only — the plant does not move — and
deliberately does not require geometric containment, reporting
`link_is_geometric` instead so the agent can flag a mismatch. Validation for all
four lives in the Qt-free `agent_api/edits.py`, whose plant-parent name set
carries a drift guard against `PLANT_PARENT_TYPES` (§8.14 / ADR-017 — note
`TRELLIS` is a plant parent but not a soil container). See ADR-036's D2.2/D2.3
addenda, FR-AGENT-15/16.

**Stacking order (issue #338, ADR-043 — outside the D2.x sequence, see
`docs/roadmap.md`'s standalone "Canvas: Per-object stacking order" section).**
A fifth tool in the same `if writes_active:` block, `arrange_object(item_id, action)`, reorders one
object within its own layer (`bring_to_front`/`bring_forward`/`send_backward`/
`send_to_back`). It does not build its own command: it calls
`ui/canvas/arrange.py::build_arrange_command` — the same seam the Edit menu,
every item's context menu, and the Properties panel's Arrange buttons call —
so the bed-carries-its-plants block and the plant-cannot-go-behind-its-bed
clamp (§8.25) apply identically whether a human or an agent triggers the move.
It raises rather than reporting a false success when the gesture is a no-op
(already at the front/back of the layer, or no overlapping object to step
past for the forward/backward step) — the same refusal-over-silent-success
precedent as `set_parent_bed`. `ObjectRef`/`ObjectDetail.stack_index` is the
read-only counterpart: a 0-based position within the object's own layer,
bottom→top, as displayed — comparable only between objects on the same layer.
**Order note:** `list_objects`, `objects_in_region`, and `get_object` are
documented as returning/reading objects **bottom→top in stacking order**
(layer order, then position within the layer) — the same order
`ProjectManager.snapshot_dict`/`_serialize_scene` now writes them in
(`reversed(scene.items())`, ADR-043) and the same order `stack_index` is
computed from. `get_diagnostics` is explicitly **not** in that order — it
walks the live scene's badge state directly and was not changed by #338.

**i18n.** MCP tool/resource/prompt descriptions are an English API contract
(exempt). Only the Settings UI strings go through `tr()`.

**Packaging.** See §7 deployment view — the `mcp`/`uvicorn`/`starlette` stack
needs `collect_submodules` + `copy_metadata` in `ogp.spec`, must NOT walk
`mcp.cli`, and must NOT exclude `multiprocessing` (uvicorn imports it).

**US-D2.4/D2.5 — layer addressing and shape/structure creation.** The curated
schema exposes layers as UUID-addressed records (`layer_id`, name, visibility,
lock, opacity, z-order, active flag, and top-level object count);
`layer_names` remains for back-compat. `list_layers` is read-only and open
like the other read tools, while the layer write tools remain behind the D2.0
double gate: `set_object_layer`, `create_layer`, `rename_layer`,
`delete_layer`, `set_active_layer`, and `set_layer_property`. They call
the existing layer commands rather than mutating `scene.layers` directly.
Visibility is undoable; the active layer is session state and therefore the
one layer operation that does not add an undo step. **A locked layer protects
its OBJECTS, and (since issue #365) the lock itself is agent-writable in both
directions.** That is a deliberate reversal of the original D2.4 decision, so
state it plainly: `set_layer_property(layer_id, locked=true|false)` locks and
unlocks through the same `SetLayerPropertyCommand` the Layers panel's own
toggle runs, as one undo step. What is unchanged is the object-level
protection — while a layer is locked, agents may not delete it, move objects
onto it, or edit objects on it — and every one of those guards tests the
layer's **current** lock state rather than a permission bit. So "unlock, then
edit" is simply two ordinary undoable calls the user can see and reverse; no
guard had to become conditional, and the tests that pin them are unchanged.
Every refusal now names `set_layer_property(layer_id, locked=False)` as the
way out, because that is the tool the agent actually has. Deleting another
layer also refuses when its replacement would be locked; the command rechecks
that precondition on redo. `set_layer_property` may change visibility and
opacity on a locked layer, because that does not alter its protected
contents.

**Document lifecycle (issue #365).** Two more token-gated tools,
`new_plan(width_cm?, height_cm?, force?)` and `open_plan(file_path, force?)`.
They are gated like `delete_object` — not merely because they mutate, but
because they **replace the open document and can discard unsaved work**, which
is strictly more destructive. Both reuse the GUI's own paths rather than
reimplementing them: `_on_new_project` was extracted into
`_new_project_document`, and `_open_project_file` was split into a raising
`_load_project_file` plus its modal-reporting GUI wrapper, so an agent never has
a `QMessageBox` appear on its behalf. Each **refuses on a dirty plan unless
`force=true`**: the GUI asks the user at that point and an agent cannot, so the
choice is binary. `new_plan` keeps the current canvas dimension for any
argument omitted and **refuses** an out-of-range or non-finite one rather than
clamping. `open_plan` requires an existing `.ogp` file and is deliberately
**not** sandboxed (a loopback-only server grants no filesystem access a local
MCP client does not already have — see `agent_api/exports.py`). Neither is an
undo step: a new or loaded document resets the stack. Both declare
`PlanLifecycleResult`, not `ExportResult` — neither writes a file, and reusing
`ExportResult` made every successful call raise a `ValidationError` while
body-level tests stayed green.

`create_object` now covers the curated GUI roster by canonical geometry
family: circles, rectangles, ellipses, polygons, polylines, and callouts. The
input contract is explicit: centres and extents are centimetres in the native
CAD Y-up scene frame; polygon/polyline vertices pass through unchanged;
polygons also accept a centre plus width/height convenience form; and callouts
retain their stable item id through save/load. The loader's
`ProjectManager._deserialize_item_core` remains the sole construction path,
so agent-created objects and loaded objects cannot acquire divergent defaults.
`HOUSE` creation builds its linked `ROOF_RIDGE` with the shared
`core.roof_ridge` geometry helper and groups both items into one undo command.
`ROOF_RIDGE`, `GARDEN_JOURNAL_PIN`, `GENERIC_TEXT`, and legacy
`HEDGE_SECTION` are deliberately refused with machine-readable reasons;
`list_creatable_types` exposes both the supported roster and these
exclusions. The union of those two sets is drift-guarded against
`ObjectType`, so a new enum member cannot silently become an undocumented
agent capability. No `FILE_VERSION` change is required: the schema additions
are additive and the new item data uses existing serialisation shapes.

**Low-level geometry escape hatches (US-D2.6, issue #330).** The stable read is
`get_geometry(item_id)`, not `get_object(raw=True)`: the latter intentionally
exposes pre-transform serializer storage. `ui/canvas/geometry_inspect.py` runs on
the Qt main thread and reports the same centre semantics as `get_object`, but maps
current polygon/polyline vertices through `mapToScene()`, plus native extents or
radius, rotation, curve/leader data, vertex capability/minimum count, and every
referencing constraint in deterministic `(type, id)` order. The read is
unauthenticated and never mutates or dirties the plan. Locked-layer and journal
objects remain inspectable; group members remain non-addressable because the
rest of the curated object surface addresses only top-level ids.

Four writes share the ADR-036 gate. `set_object_position(item_id, x, y)`
validates a finite, canvas-reachable absolute centre, converts it to a delta, and
enters the same orchestration as `move_object`: logical bed children move with
the parent, plant bed membership is reconciled, and the documented reparent case
remains the only two-step move. `set_vertex`, `add_vertex`, and `delete_vertex`
support only the polygon/polyline protocol. Qt-free `agent_api/edits.py` owns
finite/reachable point validation, zero-based index semantics (an append uses
`index == vertex_count`), and the deletion minimum supplied by the item's
vertex-editing protocol (3 for a polygon, 2 for a polyline). Every accepted topology write is
one `AddVertexCommand`/`DeleteVertexCommand`; set is one `MoveVertexCommand`.
Their callbacks are built only by `geometry_apply.py`, which the interactive
vertex commit paths also call. A HOUSE topology change invokes the item's
existing linked-ridge reprojection hook, keeping the ridge attached through
execute/undo/redo without turning the agent operation into a second command.

The coordinate-frame rule has one precision guard: if a `set_vertex` target is
within `1e-9 cm` of the current live vertex, `local_vertex_for_scene()` reuses
the exact current local `QPointF`; otherwise it uses `mapFromScene`. A raw
scene→local→scene inverse at 215° drifted by about `5.7e-14 cm`, so without the
guard an unchanged request could look like a real mutation. The tool then refuses
that unchanged request as a no-op with no command, history entry, or dirty state;
the epsilon is noise detection, not a user snap mode. A moved-then-restored
vertex leaves the serialized object byte-identical.

**Constrained geometry remains permanently refused.** `_agent_require_unconstrained`
is the one perimeter for absolute positioning, move, resize, rotate, species
assignment when it resizes, and all vertex writes. The error names the first
constraint type/UUID; `get_geometry` exposes the complete blocking set so the
agent can explain why. This is final, not “solver deferred”: silently skipping
`CanvasView`'s live multi-item solver would violate user intent. Solver-backed
agent writes require a separate proof/design. Arrays, booleans,
trim/extend/fillet/chamfer, align, mirror, and group/ungroup remain a named
follow-up backlog. `delete_object` is the one policy exception and removes
referencing constraints as part of its existing GUI-equivalent delete contract.
Every refusal occurs before command execution, leaving scene, constraints,
undo/redo, and dirty state untouched. No `FILE_VERSION` change.

**Follow-up hardening (issues #353 and #355).** The global GUI/agent history is
one `CommandManager` stack, not a second MCP history. Authenticated `undo` and
`redo` preflight the relevant stack, reverse or reapply exactly one command on
the Qt main thread, and return a `HistoryResult` containing the command
description and the post-call `can_undo`/`can_redo` flags. An empty stack is a
refusal; it is never a successful no-op. Project loading uses one centralized
predicate for serialized document items, so same-scene loads remove old
callouts and Arc/Bezier items as well as the original shape roster. Compare and
dimension overlays keep their explicit controller cleanup, and a broad
`CanvasScene.clear()` is not substituted for that ownership boundary. Agent
`delete_object` additionally refuses duplicate live UUIDs and checks that every
requested target is detached before returning success.

Callout input is validated in `agent_api/creates.py` before the loader receives
it. `box_dx` and `box_dy` remain signed so the GUI's normal above/below/left/
right placement works, but each is finite and bounded by
`abs(offset) <= 2 * max(canvas_width_cm, canvas_height_cm)`, including the
resolved defaults. The MCP wrapper uses a private omission sentinel because
some JSON stacks normalize Infinity/NaN to `null`; explicit null is rejected
rather than silently becoming the default offset. Thus oversized, negative-oversized, and non-finite calls
leave both the scene and undo stack untouched, while normal callouts still
save/load, render, and delete through the existing paths. The benchmark
hardening for #354 is documented in FR-SNAP-06 and ADR-020: one warm-up plus
five samples, with median build/query limits calibrated for shared runners.

**Canvas clamping (issue #380).** Agent writes are clamped to the plan canvas,
joining the GUI, and the earlier "stage an object just off-plan" allowance is
retired. The rule lives once for the canvas-view clamp paths and the agent paths (the properties panel's numeric X/Y, the mirror tool and the resize handle still carry their own copies — not yet migrated), Qt-free, in `core/canvas_bounds.py`
(`clamp_shift_within_canvas`, `clamp_delta_within_canvas`,
`rect_intersects_canvas` over `(left, top, right, bottom)` tuples). The GUI's
`CanvasView._clamp_items_to_canvas` / `_clamp_delta_to_canvas` call it, and so do
`GardenPlannerApp._clamp_agent_items_to_canvas` (creation) and
`_agent_apply_object_move` (move / absolute position). It is applied in the
application layer, where live bounding rects exist — `agent_api/creates.py` stays
further Qt-free. `create_object` shifts the whole creation group (a HOUSE and its
linked ridge together); a move clamps the item plus any plants it carries, so an
offset that would strand the group is trimmed to the edge. `BackgroundImageItem`
is exempt, matching the GUI. `require_reachable_position` remains only as the
refuse-absurd gross guard and still leaves the scene and undo stack untouched on
refusal. An object already saved off-plan by an older build — which clamping
cannot recover, because the GUI clamp touches only the items being moved — is
made discoverable instead: `ObjectRef`/`ObjectDetail` carry `outside_canvas`
(bounding-box based; an empty canvas never flags) and `get_diagnostics` gains an
`outside_canvas` kind, harvested by the existing
`ProjectManager.diagnostics_snapshot`. `set_vertex`/`add_vertex`/`delete_vertex`
are **not** clamped (they are outside the GUI's five clamp sites) and are covered
by the flag only — a deliberate scope boundary recorded in the ADR-036
addendum.

**Domain-intelligence tools (US-D3.1 #319, US-D3.2 #331).** D3 wrapped domain engines
that already existed and were already Qt-free, and made them reachable. Both slices
add one Qt-free module, `agent_api/domain.py`, holding the pure functions; the
`AgentProviders` callables in `application.py` marshal them across
`MainThreadBridge.run_on_main`. Three conventions carry across both slices and are
what the next D3 slice should follow:

- **Honest degradation beats a plausible empty answer.** A component that did not
  check something must not report a result that reads as a successful check. D3.1
  returns `spacing_ok`/`soil_ok` as `None` ("not checked", never a fabricated
  `True`) and `overall: "unknown_bed"` for an id that resolves to nothing (never
  `"neutral"`, which reads as "I looked and there was nothing"). D3.2 reports
  `has_plan: false` for "no plan" as distinct from an empty plan, and
  `coverage: "no_frost_dates"` **together with** month-based fallback segments
  rather than an empty segment list.
- **Deterministic ranking with a stable final tiebreak.** D3.1 caps candidates at
  60 and results at 50 and pins identical ordering on repeat calls. D3.2 sorts on
  `(fits_window desc, days_to_maturity asc, species_key asc)`; both are pinned by
  a same-input-twice test *and* a reversed-input-order test, because a suite that
  only re-runs the same order cannot see an unstable tiebreak.
- **`species_key` is derived, never invented (ADR-016).** It is a module-level
  function over a dict (`models/plant_data.py`), not an attribute of a species
  record, and its priority is `source_id -> scientific_name -> common_name` - so a
  bundled plant's key is its **scientific** name. `"beans"` is not a valid key;
  `"phaseolus vulgaris"` is. An implementation that reads a `species_key`
  attribute silently gets `""` for every candidate.

**Machine fields vs display strings.** Across the agent surface, fields an agent
should *branch on* are the English API contract. The tool-side free text (D3.2's
`reasons[]`) is **English and never localised** — ADR-033 makes MCP output an
English contract — so it is documentation, not something to parse. D3.2's
`reasons[]` and D3.3's generated task titles are therefore different problems:
the latter DO cross the boundary translated, and D3.3 owns that decision.
D3.2's `suggest_succession` is the worked example: branch on
`species_key` / `family` / `days_to_maturity` / `fits_window`; `reasons[]` is
prose. Note the asymmetry that makes this necessary - `services/task_generator.py`
and `services/soil_service.py` build their task titles and amendment names with
`QCoreApplication.translate`, because the GUI is their primary consumer, so those
strings cross an API boundary localised. Do not force English at the generator.

**D3.1's companion `name` follows the same rule (issue #410).** `suggest_companions`
returns `species_key` (a stable machine key) beside `name` (a display string in the
user's current UI language, selected from `companion_planting.json`'s `name_de` by
`app/settings.py::active_language()`). Branch on `species_key`, never on `name`. The
D3.1 tool predated the D3.3/D3.4 convention and shipped with the English default; the
fix brought it into line. The generated soil-amendment task titles obey the same rule
(issue #408), with the extra constraint that the task **id** keeps the English data name
so saved task status survives a language switch.

**The D3 localisation convention (US-D3.3 #332 + US-D3.4 #333, decided).** Epic
#237 required one answer across both stories, so this is stated once here and in
the ADR-034 addendum. Every D3 tool carries **two field classes**:

| Class | Fields | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| machine keys | `task_id` / `task_type` / `source`; `amendment_id` / `target_kind` / `fixes` / `reason_codes` | **Stable English.** Part of the API contract. Never localised. |
| display strings | `title` / `notes`; `display_name` / `reasons` | **The user's current UI language.** Explicitly NOT part of the English contract. |

Consequences worth stating because they are all easy to get wrong:

- **The agent layer passes the localised string through; it never translates.**
  The translation stays upstream in `task_generator` / `soil_service`, where the
  GUI already depends on it. `tests/unit/test_agent_d3_localisation.py` pins the
  pass-through *and* the upstream translation separately — asserting only "the
  title changed" would pass even if the wrapper had invented its own translation.
- **Amendment names are data, not translations.** `Amendment.name` / `name_de`
  are bilingual *data* fields, so `display_name` is *selected*. The convention is
  unchanged either way: `amendment_id` never moves with the UI language.
- **`task_type` carries the distinction `source` cannot.** `Task.source` has six
  values — `calendar`, `propagation`, `succession`, `soil`, `frost`, `manual` —
  for seven generators, because both soil generators emit `source="soil"`. The
  amendment and mismatch tasks are told apart by `task_type`
  (`soil_amendment` vs `soil_mismatch`), so **filtering by `source` alone cannot
  select one of them.** A drift guard asserts the tuple equals the engine's set
  in *both* directions (§11.4: a subset-only guard let two values that no
  generator emits through, which made the working value refused and the
  non-working one return an empty list).
- **Hidden statuses match the Tasks tab exactly.** `get_tasks` hides `archived`
  and `dismissed` by default because `ui/views/tasks_view.py` hides those two.
  Hiding only `dismissed` would make the agent a third surface disagreeing with
  the other two about one shared store — invariant 6.
- **Degradation is never silence.** A plan with no geo-location has no frost
  dates, so the calendar and propagation generators produce nothing;
  `coverage: "no_frost_dates"` says so and still returns every other task kind.
  A bed with no soil test gets `coverage: "no_soil_test"`, which means *untested*
  and never *healthy*. An empty list is never the whole answer.

**Soil reads need provenance, not just a reading.** `SoilService.get_effective_record`
applies its documented hierarchy (bed's own latest → plan-wide default's latest →
none) and returns the record alone. For an agent that is unusable: with only a
plan-wide test recorded it hands back the global record *for a bed*, and the
caller cannot tell that from a real bed reading. `SoilStatus.record_source`
(`'bed'` / `'global'` / `'none'`) restores the distinction, and the provider
uses `SoilService.get_effective_record_with_source` to obtain the record, source
and matching history together. The existing `get_effective_record` delegates to
that same resolver. Staleness follows the selected history, including a global
fallback; checking an empty bed history against an old global reading incorrectly
reported it as current.

**D3 transport envelopes and period generation.** `get_soil_status` always
returns `SoilStatusListView.beds`, with one result for a requested bed or all
soil-capable beds when omitted. `get_soil_mismatches` returns
`SoilMismatchBedsView.beds`, keyed by bed UUID, preserving each bed's `coverage`,
`total` and disagreements. Its aggregate coverage distinguishes `no_beds`,
`no_soil_test`, `partial_soil_tests` and `ok`. The soil prompt extracts the
requested bed from both envelopes before rendering; it never treats an envelope
as one bed. Real-client integration tests use `app._build_agent_providers()` and
call all nine new tools and both prompts over HTTP, including authenticated
writes, refusals and undo. Direct provider tests remain useful but cannot detect
an MCP response-schema mismatch.

`build_plan_state(today, year, actionable_only, include_propagation)` separates
the reference date from the calendar year. Annual agent calendars and explicit
task windows retain inactive dated tasks (`actionable_only=False` at the call
site), then classify urgency against the actual reference date. Cross-year
windows are clipped to each requested year before month bucketing.
`generate_for_date_window` uses one snapshot and the shared generators for the
frost-anchor years capable of overlapping the requested dates, deduplicating
absolute tasks. The range is derived from species offsets and generated
propagation steps: autumn garlic sowing precedes its anchor year, while asparagus
harvest extends three years. Annual calendars use this same path; anchor-year
task IDs remain stable.

**GUI reminder surfaces (#414, ADR-029 addendum).** The Tasks tab and the
planting-calendar dashboard no longer call the generators directly. They call
`task_generator.generate_actionable_for_surface(state)`, which wraps
`generate_for_date_window` and then re-applies the GUI's own listing rule
(`classify_urgency(...) is not None`). Two details are load-bearing and neither is
optional:

- **`actionable_only=False` is passed INWARD.** `generate_for_date_window` builds
  each anchor year with `replace(state, ...)`, so the caller's flag is inherited
  *per anchor year*. Passing the GUI's `True` into it filters anchors out before
  the outer filter ever runs — which is exactly what it did, producing an empty
  Tasks tab and a blank Gantt. The helper passes `False` inward and filters once at
  the edge.
- **Undated tasks pass through, and manual tasks are never urgency-filtered.**
  `classify_urgency` dereferences both dates and `generate_manual_tasks` emits
  undated tasks (`date=None`), so calling it unguarded raised `TypeError` and took
  both tabs down for a plan the agent's own `add_manual_task` creates. Manual
  tasks are additionally merged in from their own generator rather than harvested
  from the date-window pass, because they carry absolute dates and so fall outside
  the date span; their generator documents that a manual to-do is never filtered by
  urgency.

The **Gantt** deliberately uses the *unfiltered* `generate_for_date_window` over
Jan 1 – Dec 31, because a calendar chart is not a reminder list: routing it
through the reminder helper dropped most of the chart. Two entry points, two
declared purposes, neither reimplementing the other. The chart draws the windows
the generators produced rather than re-deriving them from `last_frost` plus raw
offsets — which had made it a second independent implementation of "offset to date" (the callers only *call* `generate_calendar_tasks`, so the old count was high) and the reason it could only ever draw one anchor year.
Absolute propagation overrides instead use their start-date year as the task's
owner year in the shared generator. This preserves one identity across GUI and
agent reads and prevents wider anchor ranges from multiplying one saved step.
Propagation plans use the extracted `build_propagation_plans` calculator
shared with the GUI, preserving seed-packet germination values and user overrides.
Missing frost dates still prevent those plans from being computed.

Amendment display names use `Amendment.display_name(language)` with the app's
language, just as the GUI does; stable amendment IDs do not change. Soil-write
arguments use strict numeric MCP annotations so booleans and numeric strings
cannot be coerced into readings before the domain validator sees them.
An empty amendment list means the engine recommends nothing from the readings
it can assess; it does not prove healthy soil. Existing GUI lab-only records
may have no assessed kit values and keep an unknown health result.

**Secondary nutrients have no health rating, and `None` is the honest answer.**
`SoilService.health_level` rates `ph`, `n`, `p`, `k` and `overall` — its
`ALL_PARAMS` is exactly those five. Passing `'ca'` / `'mg'` / `'s'` **falls
through to the `overall` branch** and returns the whole bed's rating. So
`SoilReading.health_level` is `str | None`, and `None` for a secondary means *"no
rating exists"* — deliberately distinct from `'unknown'`, which means *not
tested*. `overall_health_level` likewise covers **pH and N/P/K only**; the
secondaries do not drag it down. Reporting the overall rating as calcium's would
be a confidently wrong answer, which is the same trap D3.1 closed by reporting
`unknown_bed` instead of a clean-looking `neutral`.

**A rotation rule that looks reusable and is not.** D3.2's
`suggest_succession` must exclude a candidate that conflicts with a crop planted
*earlier in the same succession plan*. `CropRotationService.check_plant_placement`
cannot supply that: it compares the candidate only against `records[0]`, the single
most recent planting record, so it cannot see "tomato after the garlic entry three
slots ago" - and succession entries never enter rotation history at all, since only
the Crop Rotation panel writes `PlantingRecord`s. Succession is several crops in
ONE season; that service models one record per season across years. So the
**cross-year** 3-year family cooldown is reused verbatim via
`get_recommendation(bed_id).avoid_families` (already Qt-free, already feeding
`get_diagnostics`), while the **within-plan** rule is new logic confined to
`agent_api/domain.py`. Calling the existing method would have looked correct,
passed a casual test, and excluded almost nothing.

**Season segments are four, and the no-location fallback is shared.**
`models/succession.py::SEASON_SEGMENTS` is `early_spring`, `late_spring`, `summer`,
`fall` - frost-relative boundaries documented in the module docstring. Segments are
contiguous and inclusive at both ends, so a date exactly on the
`early_spring`/`late_spring` boundary resolves to `early_spring`
(`date_to_segment` returns the first match). A plan with no geo-location has no
frost dates; the calendar-month fallback that handles that lived in
`succession_plan_dialog.py` as a private table, and D3.2 **moved** it to
`models/succession.py` as `compute_fallback_segments`, with
`resolve_season_segments(year, location) -> (segments, are_fallback)` as the single
entry point both the dialog and the agent call. Copying it would have let an agent
and the GUI disagree about what "summer" means for the same bed.

## 8.20 Solar Coordinate Discipline (Phase 14 sun/shade)

The one rule: **do all solar/shadow math in scene centimeters, once, and
flip nothing.** Scene coordinates ARE the CAD coordinates the user sees —
+x = East, +y = North (ADR-002; `ogp-qt-cad-reference` §1 owns the
reconciliation with Qt's abstract Y-down description). Only pixel-facing
surfaces (render/export/minimap) apply a Y-flip, and they already do it
themselves (`render_scene_region(y_flip=True)`).

**From compass azimuth to scene vector.** Azimuth `Az` is a compass bearing
clockwise from true north, so the sun's horizontal direction in the scene
frame is `(sin Az, cos Az)` and the shadow extends opposite:
`d_scene = (−sin Az, −cos Az)`. Shadow length is `L = h / tan α`
(`core/shadow_geometry.shadow_length_cm`, geometric elevation, flat ground).

**Worked example (oracle-pinned).** Berlin 52.52N/13.405E,
2026-06-21 12:00 UTC → α = 59.29°, Az = 203.74°. `sin Az = −0.4025`,
`cos Az = −0.9154` → `d_scene = (+0.4025, +0.9154)` — mostly **north**,
slightly east (early-afternoon sun just west of south → shadow falls NNE).
A 100 cm object casts `L = 59.4 cm`; its tip sits at
`base + 59.4·(0.4025, 0.9154)`.

**In a rendered image** (`y_flip=True`, §8.19 formula
`px_y = image_height_px − (y_cm − region_y_cm)·px_per_cm`): the northward
tip has the *larger* scene-y → the *smaller* pixel-y → nearer the image
top — exactly where North renders. Consistent, not a paradox.

**The classic bug** is "correcting" the y-component a second time at some
item-construction or render boundary — that double flip mirrors every
shadow south. The binding pixel test in
`tests/integration/test_shadow_overlay.py` renders the live scene and
asserts the tip lands at the formula-predicted pixel; if a change mirrors
shadows, that test fails before any human has to eyeball a canvas.

**Recompute discipline** for canvas-scale overlays (shadow overlay,
heatmap): precompute on change — `scene.changed` debounced (150 ms) +
`stack_changed` for repaint-less metadata edits — cache the result, and
let `paint()` only draw the cached path. Guard every timer start with
`contextlib.suppress(RuntimeError)` (#230).

**Threaded canvas-scale computation** (US-E4 heatmap; the pattern for any
seconds-scale analysis): snapshot plain data on the GUI thread
(`collect_shadow_casters` — never live QGraphicsItems across threads),
run a `_WeatherFetchWorker`-shaped `QThread` whose results come back via
signals, paint only `QImage` in the worker (`QPixmap` is GUI-thread-only;
the QImage license is pinned by a 2-thread smoke test), recompute **on
demand only** (a button — never `scene.changed`), and **join the worker
before teardown** (`shutdown()` from `closeEvent`): a `QThread` destroyed
while running aborts the interpreter (#230 class).

**The 3D frame (US-E6)** adds ONE more mapping, applied exactly once at
the engine-adapter boundary: scene `(E, N, up)` → Qt3D Y-up
`(E, up, −N)` (`core/scene3d.to_engine_frame`; determinant +1, winding
preserved). All mesh math stays in the scene frame in Qt-free
`core/scene3d.py`; only `ui/view3d/qt3d_adapter.py` may import
`PyQt6.Qt3D*` (ADR-038's engine-swap insurance). The sun vector's ground
projection is pinned exactly opposite the 2D shadow direction — if the
3D light and the 2D overlay ever disagree, a unit test fails first.

## 8.21 Icon System (#279, ADR-039)

### 8.21.1 The contract

All chrome icons (main/constraint toolbars, gallery category chips, every
menu action and submenu title, status-bar segments, dashboard tabs, panel
and dialog markers — since #310 the whole chrome, see 8.21.5) live in
`resources/icons/ui/` on one binding contract:
`viewBox="0 0 24 24"`, root `fill="none" stroke="currentColor"
stroke-width="2"` with round caps/joins; colors restricted everywhere to
`none`, `currentColor` (the primary line) and the **accent sentinel
`#3D8B37`** (replaced with the theme's `accent` at render time; it equals
the light-theme accent so raw files preview correctly in editors). No
`<text>` (i18n rule — icons are language-neutral), no rasters, no
`<style>`/`<defs>`/`<g>`. Vendored glyphs come from Tabler Icons (MIT,
pinned release — `PROVENANCE.md` + `LICENSE-tabler-icons.txt`); the rest
are bespoke. The binding house-style contract and the add-an-icon
checklist live in `resources/icons/ui/README.md`.

### 8.21.2 The provider (`ui/icons.py`) — the ONLY render path

QSvgRenderer resolves `currentColor` to **black**, never the palette —
the reason the legacy set carried baked hex overrides (§11.4). The
provider substitutes the active theme's colors into the SVG text BEFORE
rasterizing (`get_icon(name, size=24, color=None)` / `get_pixmap`),
renders at devicePixelRatio (crisp at 125/150 % Windows scaling; the dpr
is part of the cache key, so mixed-DPI monitors stay sharp), adds a
fully-grayed Disabled variant (both tokens → `text_disabled`), caches per
`(name, size, dpr, tint, accent)`, and returns `None` for unknown names so
every caller's text fallback keeps working — for `QAction`s and buttons that
still carry text; the pixmap-only labels of #310 (status bar, collapsible
chevron, crop-rotation status, constraint type) show an empty label instead,
which is why the code→file gate exists. Category chips pass their
muted identity tint (`theme.CATEGORY_ICON_TINTS`) as `color`.

### 8.21.3 Refresh protocol (theme switch without restart)

A theme listener registered at import clears the provider cache on every
`apply_theme()`; the propagation walk (§8.4.3) then calls
`refresh_theme_icons()` on the three toolbars — buttons re-request icons,
`gallery_data.refresh_icon_thumbnails` re-renders icon-derived gallery
thumbnails (species/texture art is theme-neutral and untouched), each
`CategoryDropdown.refresh_thumbnails()` re-pulls its labels — and on the
main window (tracked `_icon_actions` menu replay; since #310 also
`_icon_labels` for status-bar pixmap labels, `_tab_icons` for the dashboard
tabs and the frost badge's last state) and on every panel/widget that
exposes its own `refresh_theme_icons` (layers panel rows, weather card,
calendar dashboard + propagation detail, plant-search filters and rows,
collapsible panels, sun-sim toolbar, constraint rows, journal/companion
rows, season manager, succession notes, the 3D window). **Rule (#310 review):
a widget that bakes a provider pixmap or icon at construction MUST expose
`refresh_theme_icons` — the text glyph it replaced followed the palette for
free, a baked pixmap does not.** Widgets constructed after the switch simply
call `get_icon()` fresh. The properties panel
opts in with a DEFERRED full-rebuild hook (singleShot(0) — never rebuild
form widgets inside the walk that invoked the hook; the #200 focus guard
still protects a focused field).

### 8.21.4 Gates & how to add an icon

`scripts/normalize_icons.py` (deterministic canonicalizer — idempotence
is itself a check; `--check` for CI drift) and
`scripts/check_icon_conformance.py` (contract + PROVENANCE cross-check in
both directions), pinned into pytest by `tests/unit/test_icon_conformance.py`;
end-to-end rendering on both themes + app wiring + live-switch re-tint by
`tests/integration/test_icon_system.py` (§8.10). Adding an icon: vendor
from Tabler (note glyph + release) or author bespoke at 24×24 → run the
normalizer → add the PROVENANCE entry → reference it by name in code →
gates green. **No provenance entry, no merge** (asset-forge discipline).
Since #310 a code→file gate (`tests/unit/test_icon_names_referenced_in_src.py`)
also fails when a literal icon name in `src/` (provider calls, the app's
`_set_action_icon` / `_make_icon_label` / `_set_tab_icon` helpers, `.get(…,
"fallback")` literals, the panels' lookup tables, the toolbar rows and the
built gallery) has no file — the drift that had `properties_panel.py`
requesting a non-existent `lawn.svg` for months.

### 8.21.5 Comprehensive coverage (#310, Package 3c)

Everything the user sees as an icon goes through the provider — there is no
second class of "text glyphs that look like icons". Concretely: every menu
action and submenu title in all six menus (per-format Export glyphs, the
Align/Distribute and Auto-Save submenus, Plants/Garden/Help residue), the
status bar (a 14 px pixmap `QLabel` in front of every segment, tooltip'd,
tracked in `_icon_labels`; the sun-hint icon follows the hint's visibility
via an event filter), the dashboard tabs (`setTabIcon`, tracked in
`_tab_icons`), the frost badge (icon tinted with `on_status`, state kept so
the theme walk re-applies it), the View menu's grouped submenus (Snapping /
Overlays / Sun & 3D — the flat list of 22 toggles was hard to scan; the
toggle attribute names are unchanged so callers/tests keep working), the
layers panel (eye/eye_off/lock/lock_open tinted accent / text_secondary /
warning), the constraints panel (a type-icon column reusing the constraint
toolbar's glyphs; row text is now "A – B   detail"), seed viability, task /
calendar urgency (painted themed dot — a `QPixmap` drawn with `QPainter`, not
a font glyph), go-to arrows, plant-search type filters (`QCheckBox.setIcon`),
weather (condition map returns provider icon NAMES; the widget renders them
and re-renders its last forecast on theme switch), journal photo marker,
companion star, collapsible chevron/info, season manager status, the
sun-sim and soil-overlay toolbars, and the theme's spin-box arrows (path
SVGs — a `<text>` glyph depends on the system font). What deliberately stays
text: arrows inside sentences ("File → Set Location", "A → B: reason",
"pH 5.8 → 6.5" — named exceptions in the static guard, which scans every
string constant — f-string parts and escapes included — of every module
under `src/`, with a named list of exception files), canvas TEXT (dimension prefixes "↔ 1.20 m", the constraint tools'
on-canvas preview labels "≡ H (same Y)" / "⊙ On Circle" / "⦿ Coincident",
the succession badge's bullets — drawn in the app font on the canvas, not
chrome; the one emoji among them, "🔒 Fix in place", is gone because emoji
glyphs are font-dependent), the update banner's external-link arrow ("What's
new ↗", typography), and the combo separator rows ("── Paths ──"). Radio
groups (Theme, Language, Auto-Save intervals) carry the icon on the submenu
title only. The 3D window's Refresh/Walk toolbar, the crop-rotation status
prefix and the constraint rows' delete "×" were the last text-only
controls; all are iconized.

## 8.22 Plant Sprite Pipeline (#281, ADR-040)

### 8.22.1 One generator, 123 artifacts

Every SVG under `resources/plants/{species,categories}/` is produced by
`scripts/generate_plant_sprites.py` — a seeded, deterministic generator whose
recipe tables (archetype + palette + signature features per species) are the
actual source of the plant art. The committed SVGs are build artifacts:
`--check` and `tests/unit/test_plant_sprite_conformance.py` fail on any byte
drift, which also makes hand edits impossible to land. The binding style
contract lives in `resources/plants/README.md` ("Lush Sprite", user-approved
2026-07-26): shingled leaf rings, per-leaf tip→base gradients, occlusion
under every leaf, glossy fruit / chunky bloom clusters, signature
recognition cue per species. Ball-shaped canopies/mounds use **dome
foreshortening** (manual-test refinement on PR #282): leaves are largest at
the crown and radially compressed + denser toward the rim —
`sqrt(1-(rho/R)^2)` per fixed dome latitude, leaf count from the ring
circumference — so the canopy reads as a sphere seen from above. Flat
growth forms (rosettes, grass tufts, narrow-leaf cushions like lavender)
are exempt from the foreshortening: their outer leaves really are the big
ones. Star-form archetypes were reworked in the same manual-test round:
conifers are interleaved serrated branch-whorl layers (not a flat
thin-leaf star), grass/fern species are fields of clumped tufts over a
dark grounding mass (not a single center starburst), and alliums/corn are
dense double-layer fountains. The on-canvas hedge (HEDGE_POLYGON) fills
with `resources/textures/hedge.png`, regenerated in the same leaf language
via `scripts/generate_asset_forge_textures.py` (tileability-gated) — the
`hedge_section.svg` sprite only serves the plant category + legacy
rectangles. Independent of archetype, SMALL leaves everywhere (length < 12 units)
drop their frilly occlusion underlay and vein lines — a byte-budget
optimization that is visually invisible at canvas scale but does slightly
simplify e.g. rosette outer rings (visible on the sign-off contact sheet).

### 8.22.2 The two invariants

**Rotation safety**: `core/plant_renderer.py` rotates each plant by a stable
per-item random angle, so sprites are top-down with radial shading only
(light from straight above) — never a baked light direction.
**QtSvg subset**: QSvgRenderer ≈ SVG 1.2 Tiny — linear/radial gradients,
opacity, transforms, stroke-linecap; no filters, masks, clipPath, CSS or
text (enforced by an element/attribute/color **allowlist walk** over the
parsed tree in the conformance gate). The one geometry
exception: `hedge_section.svg` keeps its legacy rectangular viewBox
`10 25 80 50`.

### 8.22.3 Changing a sprite — the loop

Edit the recipe → regenerate → **visually review with the real engine**
(QSvgRenderer offscreen grids at 256/64 px — see the `ogp-asset-forge`
skill's "SVG sprite forge" section; never judge by XML or a browser render)
→ run the two gates (`test_plant_sprite_conformance.py`,
`tests/integration/test_plant_sprite_rendering.py` — the §8.10 test renders
every sprite to visible pixels through `render_plant_pixmap`, including
tint, rotation and the 16 px growth-model size) → owner sign-off on a
contact sheet for style-level changes. New species additionally need a
`_SPECIES_FILES` alias in `core/plant_renderer.py`.

## 8.23 Object Sprite Pipeline (#308, ADR-042)

### 8.23.1 One generator, 24 artifacts

Every SVG under `resources/objects/{furniture,infrastructure}/` is produced by
`scripts/generate_object_sprites.py` — a seeded, deterministic generator whose
`MATERIALS` anchor table + material primitives + one builder per object are
the actual source of the furniture/infrastructure art. The committed SVGs are
build artifacts: `--check` and `tests/unit/test_object_sprite_conformance.py`
fail on any byte drift, which also makes hand edits impossible to land. The
binding style contract lives in `resources/objects/README.md` ("Lush Object"):
rim-dark → crown-light shading per part (symmetric linear gradients across a
part's short axis, radial for round parts), occlusion halos where parts
stack, material micro-detail (plank gaps + grain + knots, brushed-metal crown
line, weave hatch + puff shading, ripples + caustic sparkles, granular clumps),
gloss on glossy materials. The primitives are reusable building blocks —
`plank`/`wood_surface`, `disc`/`ring`, `fabric`, `metal_bar`, `glass_pane`,
`water_fill`, `granular_fill`, `glow`/`flame`, `frame_box` — so a new object
is typically 20–40 lines composing them; rings are two-subpath paths (nonzero
winding) and circle-clipped planks are computed analytically because QtSvg
has no clipPath.

### 8.23.2 The three invariants

**No baked shadow / light from above**: furniture rotation is USER-controlled
(unlike the plants' stable random rotation), so a baked directional shadow
would rotate with the object and double the item-level painted shadow
(`GardenItem.SHADOW_OFFSET`, View › Shadows). The gate pins the legacy
`#00000020` shadow's absence. **QtSvg subset**: same allowlist discipline as
§8.22.2 (elements/attributes/colors walked over the parsed tree; `fill-opacity`,
`stroke-linejoin` are additionally allowed here). **viewBox = nominal footprint**:
each sprite's `viewBox` is `0 0 W H` with `(W, H)` = `FURNITURE_DEFAULT_DIMENSIONS`
in cm — a gate-read metadata table (no production code sizes objects from it;
users size by dragging), pinned by the gate — the canvas stretches the art to
the user's rect; circle-tool objects (`table_round`, `parasol`, `fire_pit`, `planter_pot`,
`bbq_grill`, `rain_barrel`, `water_tap`, `trampoline`, `bird_bath`) therefore
ship **square** art (a circle item renders into a square footprint — the BBQ's
old 80×60 art was stretched on every canvas until #308).

### 8.23.3 Changing or adding an object — the loop

Edit/add the builder + `OBJECTS` row → regenerate → **visually review with the
real engine** (QSvgRenderer offscreen: canvas scale on lawn + soil, rotated
copy, 64/24 px thumbnails — see the `ogp-asset-forge` skill's "SVG sprite
forge" section; never judge by XML or a browser render) → run the two gates
(`test_object_sprite_conformance.py`; `tests/integration/test_object_sprite_rendering.py`
— the §8.10 test renders every sprite through `render_furniture_pixmap` within
the visual-weight band, at 24 px, checks letterboxed thumbnails, and drives
every new tool end-to-end) → owner sign-off on a contact sheet for style-level
changes. **Adding an object type** touches exactly these surfaces (verified
2026-08-17, ADR-042): `core/object_types.py` (enum member appended, `OBJECT_STYLES`
entry — its `fill_color` is the 3D extrusion colour —, `get_valid_types_for_shape`
branch), `core/tools/base_tool.py` (`ToolType`, same name), `ui/canvas/canvas_view.py`
`_setup_tools` (rect/circle furniture or infrastructure list), `core/furniture_renderer.py`
(`_FURNITURE_FILES` for furniture-dir types; infrastructure-dir types need
`_INFRASTRUCTURE_FILES` **and** `_SVG_DIR_OVERRIDES` **and** `_OBJECT_SVG_FILES` —
the gate checks all three; plus `FURNITURE_DEFAULT_DIMENSIONS`), `core/object_height.py`
(`DEFAULT_HEIGHTS_CM` — gives shadows/3D/height field; open structures like
swing/pergola/hammock instead go into `_HEIGHT_FIELD_TYPES`: field offered, no
default, no shadow until the user sets one), `ui/widgets/gallery_data.py`
(gallery tuple), and `scripts/fill_translations.py` in the `CanvasView`,
`GalleryData` and `ObjectType` contexts. Roster tests are map-driven; the
additive-enum forward-compat contract (unknown names → generic shape, no
FILE_VERSION bump) is pinned by `tests/unit/test_project_unknown_object_type.py`.

## 8.24 Texture Forge Pipeline (#309, ADR-042)

### 8.24.1 One generator, 24 artifacts

Every PNG under `resources/textures/` is produced by
`scripts/generate_asset_forge_textures.py`: one `generate_<name>(rng)` recipe
per texture over a shared **numpy torus painter** (`Tile`). The painter works
in float64 on a 2×-supersampled canvas whose windows are indexed modulo the
tile size — every primitive (`ellipse`/`blob`/`halo`, `capsule`, `rect`
including full-height planks, `leaf`, `vgrain`) computes analytic
anti-aliased coverage and paints with radial rim → crown shading, so anything
crossing an edge simply continues on the opposite side; noise fields
(`lattice_noise`, `fbm`, `fine_grain`) are periodic lattices, `voronoi` uses
the torus metric (with an optional periodic domain warp for organic slab
edges), and `wrap_blur` is an in-repo separable Gaussian built on `np.roll`.
Structured layouts (brick courses, planks, laths, panes, roof courses) divide
256 exactly, so a joint or bar either **straddles the wrap symmetrically**
(brick/stone/slate courses, the glazing bars — the painter samples at
pixel centres everywhere (windows, analytic fields, noise, Voronoi), so the
wrap sits exactly on the joint's mirror line and the two sides are
identical: glass 0.00/0.00, brick 0.04/0.08)
or lies **clear of it** (wood/decking plank joints at half-pitch offsets);
what must never happen is a joint landing *near* the wrap asymmetrically.
The roof's bottom course repaints its wrapped overhang — with the same RNG
state the row was drawn with, pinned by reading the rng stream
(`TestRoofTileOverhangReplay`) because no seam metric can see a tone
mismatch on a texture full of hard edges — so the overlap layering AND the
per-tile tone are seam-correct. Know what the gates catch: the seam metric
catches broken tiling, the band catches flatness, the pixel gate catches
drift; layering, replay and light-direction defects are found by reading
code and by the owner's eye (both #309 review rounds found one each). All randomness
flows through `random.Random(seed_for(name))` (`"ogp-<name>-lush"`), which is
stream-stable across CPython versions; no numpy RNG, no rasterizer, no
Pillow filter is involved — Pillow only encodes/decodes PNG. The binding
style contract ("Lush": visible detail, radial shading, concentric occlusion,
tint-readable contrast, no directional light) is the `ogp-asset-forge`
skill's §1; provenance is `resources/textures/PROVENANCE.md`.

### 8.24.2 The three invariants

**Pixel determinism, not byte determinism**: `--check` regenerates in memory
and compares the DECODED pixels of each committed PNG (pinned per file by
`tests/unit/test_texture_forge_conformance.py`). PNG is lossless, but the
deflate stream depends on the zlib build Pillow bundles — a Windows wheel and
a Linux CI wheel can encode identical pixels to different bytes — so file
bytes are deliberately not the contract, and regeneration rewrites a file
only when its pixels change (no cross-platform git churn). **Seamless on the
canvas**: `scripts/check_texture_tileability.py` (seam vs the 98th percentile
of the texture's own internal steps, threshold 1.6 unchanged since #264) must
pass for every file (`tests/unit/test_texture_tileability.py` parametrises
all of them — the #264 grandfather list `KNOWN_SEAMED_LEGACY` was emptied
and then deleted, a constant that must stay empty being ceremony), and the
§8.10 test paints the item's real tinted brush two tiles wide and checks the
wrap column AND wrap row against the same metric. **Tint-readable**: the runtime tint overlays the user colour
at 80/255 alpha; the conformance gate pins mean luminance 40–225, luminance
std ≥ 4 and local detail ≥ 2 per texture, and the integration test proves a
red vs a blue fill colour move the rendered hue without flattening the
detail (materials that would collapse under tint fail before an owner sees
them). A fourth rule is not gated but binding: **no directional light** — the
view flips Y and fills never rotate, so every shading cue is radial or
concentric.

### 8.24.3 Changing or adding a texture — the loop

Edit/add the recipe + `TEXTURES` row → run the generator (only changed files
are rewritten) → **look**: a 2×2-tiled half-scale sheet (seams, repetition)
plus 1:1 crops (detail), and the tint check with the object's real default
fill colour → run the three gates (`--check`, tileability, the §8.10 test) →
owner sign-off on a contact sheet for style-level changes → PROVENANCE
register row. Adding a texture additionally touches `core/fill_patterns.py`
(`FillPattern` member + `_TEXTURE_FILES`), the properties panel's
`_pattern_names` (translated), and `scripts/fill_translations.py`; the
conformance gate cross-checks registry ↔ loader table ↔ files on disk. A
seam that the gate reports is located by measurement, not theory: the
per-column `|row0 − row255|` (or the transpose) names the columns, and
painting the suspect primitive alone on a fresh `Tile` confirms it
(2026-08-18: a capsule whose default `taper` pointed every joint line —
§11.4, debugging-playbook row 36).

## 8.25 Stacking order within a layer (#338, ADR-043)

### 8.25.1 Model

Every document item that carries a `layer_id` also carries a sparse integer
**rank**, `stack_order: int | None` (`GardenItemMixin.stack_order`; mirrored
independently on `ArcItem`/`BezierItem`, which are not the mixin). A rank is
a **sort key**, not a display value — nothing renders it, and its absolute
magnitude is meaningless, only its ordering among the other items in the same
layer. Ranks are spaced `STACK_STEP = 1024` apart (`core/stacking.py`) so
inserting between two existing ranks never forces an immediate renumber in
practice.

**Ranks are written in exactly four places** — everywhere else only reads
`stack_order`:

1. `CanvasScene.addItem` — an item whose `stack_order is None` gets
   `max_rank_in_layer + STACK_STEP` (`_next_stack_order`).
2. `MoveToLayerCommand.execute` — only items whose layer actually changes get
   a fresh top rank in the target layer; an item already in the target layer
   is left completely alone (re-selecting an item's current layer, e.g. via
   the Properties panel combo, is a true no-op, not a silent bump to the
   top).
3. `ArrangeItemsCommand.execute` — renumbers every top-level item in each
   affected layer to `STACK_STEP` multiples in the new order; `undo` restores
   every snapshotted rank exactly (see 8.25.4).
4. `CanvasScene.suspend_z_refresh(renumber=True)` — the one-time post-load renumber
   (`ProjectManager.load` wraps its item-creation loop in that context manager).
   This is what gives a file saved without `stack_order` keys — an older app
   version — honest, evenly-spaced ranks the first time the current app opens it.

A `layer_id` of `None` (no active layer at drop time, or a bare item without
one) is ranked in its own pseudo-layer at base z 0 — the band such items
always occupied — so the derive-only clamp (8.25.3) still applies to them.

### 8.25.2 Derived z — the formula

z-values are **never** stored as intent; they are recomputed from the current
ranks on demand. `CanvasScene._layer_top_level_items(layer_id)` collects one
layer's top-level items (`parentItem() is None`, matching `layer_id`), sorted
by `(stack_order is None, stack_order, current scene index)` so an unranked
item sorts to the top of its band. `_stack_entries` turns that list into
`core.stacking.StackEntry` objects (id, plant-parent/owner-polygon id, scene
bounding rect). `_normalized_layer_order(layer_id)` runs those entries through
`core.stacking.normalize_order` (8.25.3) and maps back to live items.
`_refresh_layer_z(layer_id)` then assigns:

```python
item.setZValue(layer.z_order * 100 + 100 * (i + 1) / (n + 1))
```

over that normalized bottom→top order (`i` = 0-based position, `n` = layer
item count), for `layer_id = None` the base is `0` instead of
`layer.z_order * 100`. The fraction `100 * (i + 1) / (n + 1)` is strictly
inside the open interval `(base, base + 100)` for any `n ≥ 1` — it can never
touch `base` or `base + 100`, so a layer's items can never collide with a
neighbouring layer's band or with any fixed overlay band (8.25.6), however
many items it holds. **One accepted exception:** the `layer_id = None`
pseudo-layer shares base `0` with a real layer whose `z_order == 0` (the
default single layer every new plan starts with) — an item with no layer and
an item on that first layer can land at the same derived z. This only
matters for items reachable via a pre-#338 `.ogp` that never set `layer_id`;
current code always assigns one on `addItem`. Not fixed, since separating
the bands would need a second special-cased offset for one legacy edge case. `_update_items_z_order()` is unchanged in name and
callers — it just now loops every layer (plus the `None` pseudo-layer) and
calls `_refresh_layer_z` on each, instead of a single flat pass.

### 8.25.3 The derive-only clamp

`core.stacking.normalize_order` enforces two structural relationships,
**purely for z derivation** — it reorders a layer's list, it never writes a
rank:

- A plant (`_parent_bed_id`) always renders immediately above its parent bed,
  **only when that bed is itself present in the same layer's list** — a bed
  in a different layer is ignored, and the plant sorts as an ordinary
  top-level entry by its own rank.
- A `ROOF_RIDGE` always renders immediately above its owner polygon, under
  the identical same-layer-only condition.

Because this is a reorder-for-display step and not a rank mutation, "Send to
Back" on a lone plant does not reach the true bottom of its layer — it stops
just above its bed, and if it is already there the arrange algorithm reports
"already at back" rather than a phantom change (`core/stacking.py::_finish`
compares the candidate *after* normalization against the *already-normalized*
input, so the clamp collapsing a move to a no-op is visible as exactly that).
Group/Ungroup keep a member's `stack_order` unchanged across the transition —
grouping and ungrouping is a reparent, not an arrange. This is the one
documented exception to the exact round-trip claimed in 8.25.1/FR-STACK-06:
because an ungrouped member keeps its stale pre-group rank instead of being
re-ranked into the current sequence, it can end up tied with an unrelated
item created while the group existed, and that tie is broken by current
scene order rather than by the original session's order.

### 8.25.4 Refresh rules

**A single `CanvasScene.addItem` triggers exactly one `_refresh_layer_z` call**
for the item's layer, right after assigning a rank if it didn't have one —
unless `scene._suspend_z_refresh` is set. Two ways to set it:

- `scene.suspend_z_refresh(renumber=True)` — used by
  `ProjectManager.load` around its whole item-creation loop.
  `renumber=True` additionally does the one-time post-load renumber
  (8.25.1 point 4) before its one full refresh.
- `with scene.suspend_z_refresh(): ...` (a context manager; nests safely) —
  used by every command that re-adds several items on `execute`/`undo`
  (`CreateItemsCommand`, `DeleteItemsCommand.undo`, `MirrorItemsCommand`,
  `LinearArrayCommand`, `GridArrayCommand`, `CircularArrayCommand`,
  `ArrayAlongPathCommand`) via the shared `core.commands._bulk_add_scope`
  helper. `suspend_z_refresh(renumber=True)` is reserved for the file-load
  path only — every bulk re-add path must pass `renumber=False` (the
  default), because renumbering would silently overwrite the exact ranks a
  command's undo/redo snapshot depends on being restored unchanged.

Without this, a bulk add would trigger one O(layer-size) refresh **per item**
— O(n²) for a paste of n items into a large layer. Measured: a 50-item paste
into a 2000-object plan went from 316 ms to 91 ms.

**The refresh itself never writes a rank — ever.** This was a real draft
design, caught in review before it shipped (see the rejected alternative in
ADR-043): a refresh that also renumbered ranks as a side effect would silently
invalidate any command's undo snapshot taken before a refresh happened to run
in between — since the refresh runs on many paths unrelated to an explicit
arrange (layer visibility toggle, opacity preview, any command's unrelated
cleanup). Only the four writers in 8.25.1 ever touch `stack_order`.

Beyond `addItem`'s automatic refresh, an **explicit** refresh is needed
wherever an item becomes top-level or gets re-linked to a parent without
going through `addItem`: `GroupCommand.undo`/`UngroupCommand.execute` (members
leave the group), `_auto_parent_plant` and `SetParentBedCommand` (attach/
detach a plant), and `DeleteItemsCommand.undo` — unconditionally, whenever it
restored anything, not only when a bed's child list was touched: an undone
PLANT delete restores `parent_bed_id` alone with no bed-side relink, and a
flag gated on the child-relink branch missed that case and left the plant's
z stale below its bed (issue #338 review round 3, P0).
These call `core.commands._refresh_z_after_relink` (single item) or
`scene._update_items_z_order()` (whole scene) — never an explicit z bump. The
old `ensure_z_above_parent(child, parent)` helper — which raised a child's
`zValue()` by one above its parent's whenever they tied — is **deleted**: its
job is now done for free by the derive-only clamp every time the scene
refreshes.

### 8.25.5 The one apply seam

`ui/canvas/arrange.py::build_arrange_command(scene, items, mode) -> tuple[ArrangeItemsCommand | None, ArrangeOutcome]`
is the **only** place that groups a selection by layer, reads each layer's
current order via `scene._stack_entries`/`_normalized_layer_order`, asks the
Qt-free `core.stacking.arrange` what changes, and builds the undoable
`ArrangeItemsCommand`. Every surface that can arrange an object calls this one
function — the same discipline `ui/canvas/geometry_apply.py` established for
resize/rotate (§8.19) and for the identical reason: a `Callable`/copy-per-call-site
pattern is how the three rotated-geometry bugs in §11.4/ADR-036's D2.2 story
happened. The four callers:

1. `CanvasView.arrange_selected(mode)` — the Edit ▸ Arrange menu actions and
   the two keyboard-shortcut sets both call this.
2. `GardenItemMixin._build_arrange_menu`/`_dispatch_arrange` — the `Arrange ▸`
   context-menu submenu, shared by every item class that already has the
   `_build_move_to_layer_menu` seam (rectangle, polygon, polyline, circle,
   ellipse, text, callout, group, smart symbol). Delegates to
   `CanvasView.arrange_selected` when a view is available (so status messages
   have exactly one source), falls back to a direct build+execute for
   view-less unit-test construction.
3. `PropertiesPanel._add_arrange_section` — the "Arrange" row (four icon
   buttons), shown for a single selected item and for a multi-selection.
4. `GardenPlannerApp._do_agent_arrange_object` — the Agent API's
   `arrange_object` tool (§8.19).

No caller ever builds `ArrangeItemsCommand` directly, or duplicates
`build_arrange_command`'s layer-grouping logic. If you find yourself reaching
for a second implementation, use this seam instead.

### 8.25.6 Reserved z bands

Every fixed-z overlay in the app, low to high, alongside the per-layer band
§8.25.2 derives into:

| Band | z value(s) | What lives there |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Background image | `-1000` | `BackgroundImageItem` (satellite/reference photo) |
| Sun & shade shadow overlay | `-500` | `sun_shadow_controller.py`'s shadow-union overlay (US-E3) |
| Hours-of-sun heatmap | `-450` (fill), `-449` (contour lines), `-448` (contour labels) | `sun_heatmap.py` overlay (US-E4) |
| Construction geometry | `-10` | `ConstructionItem` — always below every regular item |
| **Per-layer document items** | `layer.z_order * 100 + (0, 100)` (open interval) | Every ordinary document item, per-object stacking order within its layer (8.25.2) — this is the band #338 subdivides |
| Dimension/constraint lines | `900` (line/witness), `901` (label/handle, `DIMENSION_LINE_Z + 1`) | `dimension_lines.py` |
| Tool overlay highlights | `999` (corner-edit/trim highlight), `1000` (measure-tool line, on-top ellipse), `1003` (constraint-tool selected marker) | `core/tools/*` in-progress-gesture previews |
| **Shape-tool preview band** | `999` (fill), `1000` (line/path), `1001` (label), `1002` (vertex/handle) — `core/tools/preview_z.py` | The in-progress preview of every shape tool (`circle`, `rectangle`, `ellipse`, `polygon`, `polyline`, `arc`, `bezier`, `mirror`, `callout`, `select`, `construction`). Issue #377: these previously had **no** z-value and drew behind any bed they overlapped. Every value MUST stay below the minimap cutoff below. |
| Transient previews | `9999` | Offset-tool preview path, paste/duplicate drag preview |
| Soil health badge | `10002` | `SoilBadgeItem` (always on top of its bed) |
| Minimap overlay-hide cutoff | `10000` (`minimap_widget._OVERLAY_Z_MIN`) | Threshold above which the minimap thumbnail hides an item as a screen-space overlay (§8.9.5) — a named constant, not a bare `100` (see the corrected note in §8.9.5) |

**`JournalPinItem` is NOT a fixed-z overlay, despite its constructor calling
`self.setZValue(9_500)`.** It is a `GardenItemMixin` with a `layer_id` and a
`stack_order`, so `supports_stacking(pin)` is True and `_refresh_layer_z`
overwrites that 9500 the moment the pin (or any sibling in its layer) is
added — a pin can end up rendering *behind* an ordinary item in the same
layer. Verified: a lone pin lands at `z=50.0`; adding one more layered item
drops it to `33.3` while the new item sits at `66.7`. This is **pre-existing**
(unbumped by #338 — `CanvasScene.addItem` already clobbered the 9500 to
`layer.z_order * 100` before this PR), not a new regression, but it means the
9500 constant is dead for any pin that has a layer. Journal pins are
deliberately excluded from Arrange (`ui/canvas/arrange.py`) and from the
agent's `arrange_object` tool, but nothing today re-asserts their z above the
document band once one is set. Fixing this — either exempting pins from
`supports_stacking` or giving them a real fixed post-refresh bump — is
tracked as follow-up work, not part of #338.

A per-layer band can, in principle, grow past `z_order * 100 + 100` only if
`z_order` itself is large enough to reach the next fixed band above — not a
concern at the layer counts this app supports, and unchanged by #338 (the
formula was already `layer.z_order * 100` before per-object stacking; #338
only subdivides the same band, it does not widen it).

## Creative visual-preview pattern (approval pending)

The Creative experiment reuses semantic theme roles with optional color
overrides and the existing listener/icon/redraw hooks. Additional QSS targets
named preview components. Font selection uses installed-family lookup, without
startup downloads or new bundled binaries. The proposed dark palette is
contrast-tested independently of the neutral, always-light drawing surface.

The main window adds docks around whole containers, never reparents ordered
SidebarController panels. A secondary LayersPanel routes requests through
existing commands and stays synchronized with the scene. The inherited property
form wraps labels above controls in the experiment; long content scrolls.

New UI strings use the CreativePreview translation context. Inherited welcome
methods use the subclass Qt context, so CreativeWelcomeDialog registers their
footer/empty/missing-file strings too. This is verified by loading the compiled
German translator in `tests/integration/test_creative_design_preview.py`.

See [BRAND_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](../../BRAND_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md),
[ADR-050](../09-architecture-decisions/README.md#adr-050-opt-in-creative-desktop-design-preview)
and [validation](../design/VALIDATION.md). The source experiment is opt-in; broad
application styling, native packaged QA and company assets await owner approval.


### Creative presentation and headless Qt lifetime (ADR-051)

Display units belong to each document, never a process-global setting. Keep focused editor units fixed until that editor is rebuilt; preserve the original canonical value when interpreting an untouched rounded display. All geometric commands remain in cm. Architectural symbols and texture strength change painting only.

Qt.Popup is a window flag, not ownership. Parent CategoryDropdown to its toolbar even though it floats. In headless tests, processEvents does not substitute for an exec loop's DeferredDelete handling: the autouse cleanup flushes deferred deletes after pytest-qt destroys its registered widgets. This preserves assertions and avoids repeated global styling of thousands of queued closed windows. Combined Creative QSS is applied once. See the risk log and debug-verbose case for measurements.
