# OGP External Positioning — licensing, claims, ecosystem, release trust

This skill governs everything the outside world sees. The internal rule is simple:
**every public statement must be traceable to shipped, tested code or a checked-in
document.** When in doubt, under-claim and link to the roadmap.

The original survey below was verified on **2026-07-05** (then app version 1.23.0);
the Agent API write/geometry surface was re-verified on **2026-09-25 through D2.6**.
Re-run the commands in "Provenance and maintenance" before relying on any other
volatile fact.

## 1. Licensing obligations (GPLv3 — load-bearing, not decorative)

| Fact | Source (verified) |
|------|-------------------|
| License is **GPL-3.0-or-later** | `LICENSE` (GPLv3 full text), `pyproject.toml` line 10: `license = {text = "GPL-3.0-or-later"}` + classifier "GPLv3+" |
| **Why**: PyQt6 is GPL/commercial dual-licensed; without a commercial Riverbank license the app **must** be GPLv3 | `docs/02-constraints/README.md` §2.1 ("PyQt6 (GPLv3) — GUI framework choice requires GPLv3 licensing for the project") and §2.4 rationale |
| GPL compliance is tracked as a **risk**, not a footnote | `docs/11-risks-and-technical-debt/README.md` §11.2: "PyQt6 licensing complexity (GPL/Commercial) — Likelihood Medium, Impact High — Use GPLv3, document clearly, ensure compliance" |
| All dependencies must be GPL-compatible and free | `docs/02-constraints/README.md` §2.2 ("all dependencies must be compatible", "No Budget … all dependencies must be free/open") |

**Consequences you must enforce:**

- Any dependency bundled into the PyInstaller exe becomes part of a GPLv3 distribution.
  A GPL-incompatible license (e.g. CC BY-NC for code, SSPL, proprietary SDKs) is a
  **blocker**, not a judgment call.
- **New-dependency checklist** (run before adding anything to `pyproject.toml` /
  `requirements.txt` / `installer/ogp.spec`):
  1. Identify the dependency's license (check PyPI metadata AND the repo's LICENSE file —
     PyPI classifiers are sometimes wrong).
  2. Confirm GPL-3.0 compatibility (MIT/BSD/Apache-2.0/LGPL/GPL: yes; permissive-with-
     advertising-clause, non-commercial, or source-available licenses: no or needs analysis).
  3. Confirm it survives PyInstaller bundling (it will be *distributed*, which is what
     triggers copyleft obligations).
  4. Note the check in the PR description. Cross-ref `ogp-change-control` for the PR gates.
- **Assets are licensed too.** Per ADR-006 (`docs/09-architecture-decisions/README.md`),
  object illustrations are AI-generated then converted to SVG, chosen partly for "no
  licensing issues"; per ADR-007, fill textures are tileable PNGs, "AI-generated or CC0
  sourced". §11.1 keeps **"Texture licensing for fill patterns?"** as an *open question*
  ("Use AI-generated or CC0/public domain textures, document sources"). Treat that as
  policy: any new texture/icon must be AI-generated in-project or CC0/public-domain,
  **with the source documented**. Do not import assets of unknown provenance.

## 2. Third-party service terms

All three integrations are optional enhancements — the app is offline-capable by
constraint (`docs/02-constraints` §2.1). Never present an online feature as core.

| Service | Used for | Key/config | Terms & obligations (as documented in-repo) |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Google Maps** (JS API + Static Maps API) | Satellite background picker (`MapPickerDialog`, ADR-019) | Preferences (`api_keys/google_maps_key`) or `OGP_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` / `.env` fallback (python-dotenv). No fallback provider — feature disabled without a key. | §8.15 of `docs/08-crosscutting-concepts`: JS API display is free-tier; Static Maps burns the $200/month credit (~100k calls; app uses 1–9 per import via mosaic). **Never commit a key; never bundle the key into the release exe** — a pinned key is extractable via `strings` and abusable on the owner's bill. CI must not inject the secret into build artifacts. Each user obtains their own key. |
| **Plant APIs**: Trefle.io → Perenual → Permapeople (fallback chain in that order) | Online plant species search | `TREFLE_API_TOKEN`, `PERENUAL_API_KEY`, `PERMAPEOPLE_KEY_ID`/`_SECRET` (env or `.env`) | `docs/03-context-and-scope/PLANT_API_SETUP.md`: Trefle — free with **attribution**; Perenual — free personal/commercial; Permapeople — free **non-commercial**, data **CC BY-SA 4.0**, requires attribution + link-back. §11.2 documents the deprecation mitigation: "Fallback chain: Trefle → Permapeople → Bundled DB". A bundled species DB (118 records, ADR-014) exists as the offline layer. |
| **Open-Meteo** (`api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`) | Weather forecast widget + frost alerts (US-12.1/12.2) | No key required | Verified in `src/open_garden_planner/services/weather_service.py` (the URL is pinned and HTTPS-enforced). The repo docs do not restate Open-Meteo's usage terms — if you publish anything about the weather feature, check open-meteo.com's current terms yourself; do not invent them. |

**Rule:** when you name a provider in public text, name the one actually in the code.
"Uses a weather API" → wrong; "uses Open-Meteo" → right (and re-verify with the grep in
Provenance if the service layer has been touched).

## 3. What is genuinely novel vs known — strict claim labels

Be honest about the ecosystem. Positioning that survives scrutiny beats positioning that
sounds good.

**Known prior art — never imply OGP invented these:**
- Commercial garden planners (subscription web/desktop tools) — OGP's differentiators are
  price (free), openness (GPLv3, human-readable JSON `.ogp`), and metric precision, per
  the README's own framing.
- Generic CAD (snapping, fillet/chamfer, bezier/arc tools, DXF) — OGP *ports* CAD
  conventions to gardening; the CAD techniques themselves are standard (the roadmap even
  cites FreeCAD's Sketcher as a reference).
- MCP desktop integrations in general — MCP servers for desktop tools exist; the pattern
  is not OGP's invention.

**Candidate novelty (label as "to our knowledge" — plausible but unproven uniqueness):**
a desktop CAD-grade garden planner that **embeds a live MCP server in the running GUI**,
so any MCP client (Codex, Cursor, …) can read, query, and *see* (rendered PNG) the plan
currently open on screen. Verified basis: ADR-033 (embedded streamable-HTTP FastMCP server,
127.0.0.1-only, on by default, main-thread marshaling bridge) and ADR-034 + addenda
(curated schema, UUID addressing, spatial queries, diagnostics, `render_canvas_image`).
Nobody has done a prior-art survey — so the claim ceiling is "to our knowledge, the first
garden planner with…", never "the first" flat.

**Claimable TODAY (implemented, tested, shipped as of v1.23.0):**

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Read-only MCP surface: `get_plan_summary`, `list_objects`, `get_object`, `get_geometry`, spatial tools, `get_diagnostics`, `render_canvas_image` | US-D1.1–D1.3 and D2.6 geometry read shipped; integration tests incl. real MCP client end-to-end. `get_geometry` reports current live scene-frame vertices, not raw serializer points. |
| Optional token-gated MCP editing: create/move/set-position/resize/rotate/delete, species/bed links, layers, stacking, polygon/polyline vertex edits, global undo/redo | US-D2.0–D2.6 (ADR-036, FR-AGENT-13–21); the tools appear only when editing is enabled and a token is configured, and every call rechecks the token. Constrained geometry remains permanently refused; do not imply solver-backed edits. |
| Loopback-only, read-only, disable-able in Settings | ADR-033 (bound 127.0.0.1; Settings toggle) |
| cm-precision canvas, snap engine, bezier/arc/fillet, DXF import/export, satellite calibration | Phases 1–13 Packages A/B per roadmap/AGENTS.md, each with tests |

**MUST NOT be claimed until shipped (do not let these leak into README/releases/replies):**

| Forbidden claim | Reality (re-verified 2026-09-25 through D2.6) |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Agents can edit every geometry, including constrained objects" | **False.** D2.0–D2.6 ship optional token-gated creation, domain edits, layers, history, absolute placement, and polygon/polyline vertex edits, but every geometry-changing tool permanently refuses constrained objects because the live multi-item solver is not exposed. `get_geometry` is the unauthenticated read that explains the blocking constraints. |
| "3D visualization / sun & shade simulation" | **Shipped** (Phase 14, v1.24.5 – v1.24.12). Claimable — but only with the stated exclusions: **flat ground** (no terrain slopes), lighting-only 3D (**no engine shadow maps**), no walkthrough collision, geometric (unrefracted) sun elevation. Never imply terrain modelling. |
| "Secure/authenticated agent API" | Token auth gates **writes only** (D2.0); reads stay open on loopback trust. The token travels in the connect **URL**, so it is visible in local request logs (accepted tradeoff, ADR-036). Say "loopback-only, token-gated writes" — never "secure" or "encrypted". |
| Any "first ever" without qualifier | No prior-art survey exists. |

## 4. README claims audit discipline

The README is a public promise. Drift is real and bidirectional — as of 2026-07-05 it
**understated** the project badly (Status said *"Phases 1-5 complete"* at v1.23.0, and the
Features list omitted DXF, PDF export, the tasks/harvest/journal suite, and the MCP server
entirely). The D2.6 branch updated the Status section and added the token-gated AI Agent
Integration bullet, so re-audit the current text before publishing rather than assuming
either stale direction; under-claiming is also a claims bug. Fix it when you touch the
README, but only with shipped, tested items.

**Rules:**
- When a feature **ships**, the same change (or its release PR) updates README features/
  status, the wiki (`../open-garden-planner.wiki/Roadmap.md` — AGENTS.md's "wiki synced"
  merge gate), and lets release notes describe it accurately. When a feature is
  **dropped** (precedent: US-B7 Paper Space, dropped in PR #191 review), remove or never
  add its README mention.
- Every README feature bullet must map to a shipped FR-* entry or roadmap ✅ line. No
  bullet for anything behind a hidden panel (e.g. Smart Symbols UI is deliberately hidden
  per US-C4 — describe the engine only if you also state the UI status, as FR-25 does).
- Mechanics of *how* to write/update docs live in `ogp-docs-and-writing`; this skill only
  fixes *what may be said*.

## 5. Release trust

- **Checksums:** every release ships `SHA256SUMS.txt` (generated by `release.yml`, see
  `docs/07-deployment-view` §7.3). The README's user-facing verify command (copy verbatim,
  keep in README):

  ```powershell
  # PowerShell — replace <version> with the actual version you downloaded
  (Get-FileHash .\OpenGardenPlanner-<version>-Setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
  ```

  Compare against the hash in `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the release page.
- **Build provenance attestation (ADR-044, from the next release):** every release also
  carries a GitHub Artifact Attestation (`actions/attest-build-provenance@v4` — not v1,
  which pins a node20 action GitHub is retiring; see ADR-044's rejected-placement note —
  Sigstore-backed, no paid cert) for the installer, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, **and** the raw app
  exe the installer packages (`dist/OpenGardenPlanner/OpenGardenPlanner.exe` — the exact
  file named in issue #356's Defender report; attesting only the installer would not let
  that reporter verify the file they actually have). README's verify command (copy
  verbatim, keep in README):

  ```bash
  gh attestation verify OpenGardenPlanner-<version>-Setup.exe -R cofade/open-garden-planner --signer-workflow cofade/open-garden-planner/.github/workflows/release.yml
  ```

  This proves *source provenance* (built by public CI from public source) — it does **not**
  make the installer Authenticode-signed and does not by itself suppress SmartScreen/Defender
  warnings. Don't conflate the two in public text.
- **The installer is UNSIGNED.** Documented as a known risk: §11.1 ("NSIS installer
  signing? … Unsigned initially, document for users; investigate free code signing
  options") and §11.2 ("Windows installer blocked by SmartScreen — Document workaround").
  In any public text: state plainly that Windows SmartScreen or Defender may warn (a known
  false-positive pattern for unsigned PyInstaller-built exes, e.g. `Wacatac.B/C!ml` — see
  issue #356), that the workaround is "More info → Run anyway" *after* verifying the SHA-256
  checksum and/or the build-provenance attestation above, and never phrase the warning away
  as a false positive users should blindly click through — the checksum + attestation are
  the compensating controls.
- **CI owns releases.** Never publish a release, create a tag, or upload assets manually —
  `release.yml` auto-tags, generates checksums, and creates the GitHub Release on merge to
  master (docs/07 §7.3; AGENTS.md: "Never create git tags manually"). The docs/07 "manual
  fallback" is for CI-outage emergencies only. Pipeline mechanics: `ogp-change-control`.

## 6. Reproducibility standard for public claims

Any published number — accuracy, performance, comparison against another tool — needs a
**documented, re-runnable procedure** checked into the repo (or the claim doesn't go out).

- The model to follow is ADR-019's satellite scale: the "no manual calibration" claim
  rests on an *analytical* Web-Mercator pixel→meter derivation,
  `mpp = cos(lat) × 2π × 6378137 / (256 × 2^zoom)`, not on eyeballing. Anyone can recompute
  it. That is the bar.
- "Centimeter precision" is claimable for the **canvas model** (coordinates are stored and
  edited in cm). It is NOT automatically claimable for **satellite-derived real-world
  accuracy** — that depends on zoom, latitude, and Google's imagery georegistration. If
  you ever publish an end-to-end accuracy figure, ship the measurement procedure (known
  ground-truth distance, zoom/lat, expected mpp) alongside it. Cross-ref
  `ogp-proof-and-analysis-toolkit` for building such procedures and
  `ogp-research-methodology` for experiment write-ups.
- Benchmarks vs other software: name versions, hardware, exact steps; never compare
  against a competitor's marketing copy.

## 7. Community surface

- **Contribution channels** (README, verified): GitHub Discussions for questions/ideas,
  Issues for bugs/confirmed tasks *and* as the ready-to-pick work list, `docs/roadmap.md`
  plus its wiki mirror for what is planned next. **Do not point contributors at the
  project board** — its auto-add automation was removed in #293 and the board has been
  frozen at issue #161 since 2026-04-18; sending newcomers to a stale board is an
  oversell of the project's activity.
- **Contributor expectations** (README + docs/02 §2.3): PRs must pass CI (tests, lint,
  type check); every contribution needs unit + integration + UI tests where applicable;
  conventional commits; feature branches only. **AI-assisted development is explicitly
  welcome** — quality of result is what's judged.
- **Install-from-source** is the contributor on-ramp (README: Python 3.11+, `pip install
  -e .`, `python -m open_garden_planner`) — keep those commands working; they are a public
  claim too.
- Scope/context for what OGP is and is not: `docs/03-context-and-scope/`. Keep public
  positioning inside that scope.

## When NOT to use this skill

- Internal documentation mechanics (arc42 structure, where a lesson goes, ADR templates)
  → `ogp-docs-and-writing`.
- Branch/PR/merge/version/release *pipeline* mechanics → `ogp-change-control`.
- Deciding what future work is worth doing or claiming research directions →
  `ogp-research-frontier` / `ogp-3d-sunshade-campaign`.
- Building the app or debugging it → `ogp-build-and-run`, `ogp-debugging-playbook`.
- Purely internal code changes with no user-visible or public-facing surface — no claim,
  no skill needed.
