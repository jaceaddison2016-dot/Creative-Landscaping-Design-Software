"""Mechanical tileability check for fill-pattern textures (US-E9, #264).

Metric: a texture tiles seamlessly when its wrap seam (last column against
first column, last row against first row) is no rougher than the roughest
transitions the texture ALREADY contains. The mean-vs-mean ratio punishes
structured tiles unfairly (a decking board gap is a hard edge that repeats
every 64 px — the wrap seam legitimately looks like one), so the seam's
mean luminance step is compared against the 98th percentile of the
internal adjacent-row/column mean steps: a seamless tile's seam sits
inside its own edge family (ratio ≤ 1-ish), a genuinely non-tiling image
(e.g. a gradient, or a photo crop) towers above it.

Threshold: 1.6 — calibrated 2026-07-20 (US-E9) on the first pilots and the
wood/gravel/grass calibrators; a synthetic gradient fails by an order of
magnitude. Since Package 3b (#309, 2026-08-18) EVERY shipped texture comes
out of the numpy torus painter and passes (see the calibration note below
for the shipped maximum, quoted from the tool's own output);
`tests/unit/test_texture_tileability.py` parametrises all files, so a seamed
texture can no longer be grandfathered.

Known limitation (documented, accepted): the metric works on LUMINANCE —
a seam purely in hue at matched brightness is invisible to it. The shipped
set is tonal, so this doesn't bite; the style gate (owner's eyes) remains
the backstop for chroma-only defects.

Usage:  venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_texture_tileability.py [paths...]
(no paths = check every PNG in resources/textures/)

# Calibration note: unchanged since US-E9 (2026-07-20). The 2026-07 decking
# pilot put a board gap ON the wrap and scored x=1.55 (3 % headroom); the
# #309 set keeps every joint either symmetric on the wrap (pixel-centre
# sampling makes that exact) or clear of it. Tool output, 2026-08-18 (final
# regeneration): "pebbles.png x= 0.95 y= 0.82", "sand.png x= 0.92 y= 0.94",
# "mulch.png x= 0.81 y= 0.93", "decking.png x= 0.33 y= 0.48",

# 0.95 (pebbles, x). Recalibrate ONLY with a

# a texture against its own 98th-percentile internal step, so structured tiles
# with hard edges everywhere get proportionally more slack than organic ones.
