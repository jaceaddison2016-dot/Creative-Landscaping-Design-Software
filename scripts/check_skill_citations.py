"""Verify that identifiers cited across the skill libraries still resolve.

The skill files under ``.claude/skills/`` and ``.agents/skills/`` (plus
``CLAUDE.md`` / ``AGENTS.md``) are dense with cross-references: numbered doc
sections (``§8.10``), ADRs (``ADR-033``), functional requirements
(``FR-AGENT-03``), ``file.py:line`` citations, and GitHub issue/PR numbers
(``#336``). Nothing previously verified that those references still point at
something real. This module is that check (issue #336).

Scope, deliberately: this gate resolves *identifiers*, not *claims*. It does
not try to verify that a citation's surrounding prose is still an accurate
description of the cited thing — only that the thing named still exists.

It is also syntactic, not semantic: a ``file.py:line`` citation is only
checked when it appears in the single backtick-quoted form ``path.py:N``,
immediately followed on the same line by a backtick-quoted symbol/snippet
(``path.py:N`` `` `symbol(...)` ``), searched under ``src/``, ``tests/``,
``scripts/``, and ``installer/``. A citation with no trailing symbol is
rejected outright rather than silently downgraded to a worthless
line-count-only check.

That mandatory-symbol rule is necessary but not sufficient on its own: a
symbol span is only a real drift check if the tolerance window around the
cited line is small relative to what "drifted" means. A first version of
this rule shipped with a 300-line window and, measured after the fact,
would NOT have caught the very case that motivated it — a bare
``core/object_types.py:595/608/622`` (later found to sit wrong by 76 lines,
undetected) still resolves cleanly at 300 lines of slack even with the
correct symbol attached, because 76 &lt; 300. ``_SYMBOL_WINDOW_LINES`` is
therefore kept small (see its own comment) — small enough that real drift
gets caught, at the cost of needing an occasional one-line touch-up when a
symbol genuinely moves that far, which is the gate doing its job, not a
false alarm. A citation spelled out in prose ("application.py line ~2893")
is invisible to this gate entirely — normalize a citation into the gated
form to bring it under the gate, the same way a string has to go through
``tr()`` to be seen by the i18n gate (§8.3's own "a plain string never
reaches it" blind spot); the same is true of a markdown-link citation
(``[text](path.py#L123)``) — a different unwatched syntax, not a different
degree of protection.

Named residual, not swept under the fix: the window controls for drift
*distance*, not symbol *selectivity*. A citation naming a short, common
identifier in a large file is real but weak protection — ``execute`` in
``core/commands.py`` (2861 lines) occurs on 76 of them, so even the 20-line
window lets a citation to it resolve against ~82% of that file's possible
line numbers. Every citation in this corpus today sits at distance 0 from
its symbol (verified), so this is not live rot — but it is a known limit of
"symbol found nearby," not "symbol found precisely," and the honest fix is
a selectivity rule (reject a match against more than a couple of candidate
lines, or require a ``def``/``class`` form) that this issue does not
implement (see §11.4).
