"""Measure how the bundled harvest offsets reconcile with ``days_to_maturity``.

Committed so the #416 figures quoted in ADR-049, §11.4, the roadmap,
CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md and issue #418 have a source a reader can re-run.

    venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/measure_harvest_offsets.py

Two readings are tested against every species that carries both harvest offsets
and a maturity range:

* **A — frost-relative** (``harvest_start x 7`` inside the maturity range): this
  is what every reader actually implements (``generate_calendar_tasks``, the
  calendar Gantt, the agent's task tools, the 3D spike's fruit window).
* **B — planting-relative** ((``harvest_start`` - latest planting offset) ``x 7``,
  inside the range +/-15 %): the reading ``plant_data.py`` used to *document*.

Both readings fit a majority, which is why the row conversion was deferred on
other grounds (a cited horticultural source per row, plus licence clearance) and
NOT because the data was irreconcilable. Earlier revisions of these documents
quoted "1 fits / 63 miss" and "10 fits / 54 miss"; those numbers matched no
harness and were wrong — the senior review caught them.

Also prints, per denominator, how many species' planting-relative span lands in
1.0-1.5x their stated maturity (28 / 32 / 15 of 64 against the midpoint, the
minimum and the maximum). §11.4 once claimed "most species" did, with no
denominator and no harness; the three counts are printed together so the claim
can be checked rather than believed.

Prints the per-species misses so a mismatch is diagnosable rather than just a
different integer.
