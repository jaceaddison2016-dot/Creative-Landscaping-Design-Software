"""Regenerate tests/data/issue_registry.json from the real GitHub repo.

Dev-only helper, not run in CI (the citation gate — check_skill_citations.py —
deliberately checks against the committed snapshot instead of hitting the
network, so it stays fast and doesn't depend on GitHub being reachable or on
rate limits). Run this after adding a new #NNN reference to a skill file, or
whenever the citation gate reports an issue/PR number missing from the
snapshot:

    venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/refresh_issue_registry.py

Requires the ``gh`` CLI to be authenticated (``gh auth status``).
