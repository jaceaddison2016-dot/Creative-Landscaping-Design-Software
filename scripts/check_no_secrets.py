"""Fail if a credential-shaped string is committed anywhere in the tree.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A live Agent API write token was committed to the repo root in a throwaway
verification script and pushed, while driving the manual MCP pass for PR #369
(2026-09-29). It had to be rotated by hand.

Bandit never saw it: ``ci.yml`` runs Bandit as ``-r src/``, and the file was
at the repo root — outside that scope. Bandit also has no rule for a
credential in a URL query string, which is exactly how OGP's Agent API token
travels (ADR-036 / #366 moved the *default* hand-out to a read-only URL
precisely because that URL becomes a WRITE credential when it carries the
token).

WHY NOT gitleaks
----------------
gitleaks was tried first and rejected, for two measured reasons:

  1. Its ``generic-api-key`` rule matches on IDENTIFIER NAMES, and this
     codebase's vocabulary is saturated with them — ``species_key``,
     ``exclude_antagonists_of``, a ``"Shift+Arrow Keys"`` row in the
     translation table. A scan of this tree produced 29 findings with zero real
     secrets.
  2. Suppressing that rule is not an option, because it is the rule that
     actually catches an OGP token. A second attempt to allowlist the noise
     (``[[allowlists]]`` scoped by rule + path) was silently ignored under
     ``[extend] useDefault`` — the finding count was identical with and
     without the allowlist block.

A gate that cannot distinguish a credential from a variable name is a gate
that gets deleted after its first false alarm, and then it catches nothing.
This checker targets the specific shapes a real leak takes here, so it has no
false positives to suppress in the first place.

WHAT IT SCANS
-------------
Every git-TRACKED file (so an untracked local scratch file does not fail a
build), for:

  * ``?token=<40-50 chars>`` — OGP's own Agent API write credential, the exact
    shape that leaked. This is the one that matters.
  * Common provider key prefixes with a plausible-length body: AWS
    ``AKIA…``, GitHub ``ghp_``/``github_pat_``, Slack ``xox[baprs]-``, Google
    ``AIza``, Stripe ``sk_live_``, private-key headers, and ``Bearer <jwt>``.

Deliberately NOT matched: high-entropy strings in general, and anything that
looks like an identifier assignment. Those are what produced the 29 noise hits.
