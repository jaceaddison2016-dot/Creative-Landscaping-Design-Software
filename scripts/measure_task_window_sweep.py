"""Measure the GUI-vs-agent task-window gap that #414 fixed.

Committed so the figures quoted in ADR-029, §11.4, the roadmap,
CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md and the debug-verbose case study have a source a reader can
re-run, instead of a prose number nobody can check. Run it from the repo root:

    venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/measure_task_window_sweep.py
    venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/measure_task_window_sweep.py --wide

It prints the harness, the before/after missed counts and the surplus count. The
**surplus** is the number that matters: 0 missed can also mean "the GUI listed
everything", so a fix is only real if it missed nothing *and* added nothing.

Two harnesses, and the count depends on which:

* default -- the 64 bundled species that carry calendar offsets x 6 frost dates x
  every 10th day of 2026 (222 cases): **1,849 / 0 / 0**.
* ``--wide`` -- all 118 bundled species x 6 frost dates x every day of 2026
  (2,190 cases): **18,007 / 0 / 0**.

Quote the harness with the number. (An earlier revision of these documents quoted
"2,669", which matched neither sweep and was simply wrong; the round-4 review
caught it. Both figures above are printed by this script.)
